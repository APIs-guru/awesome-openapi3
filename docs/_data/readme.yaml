  # ⨁ gnostic


  This repository contains a Go command line tool which converts JSON and YAML

  [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) descriptions to and

  from equivalent Protocol Buffer representations.


  [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) provide a

  language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing

  structured data. **gnostic**'s Protocol Buffer models for the OpenAPI

  Specification can be used to generate code that includes data structures with

  explicit fields for the elements of an OpenAPI description. This makes it

  possible for developers to work with OpenAPI descriptions in type-safe ways,

  which is particularly useful in strongly-typed languages like Go and

  [Dart](https://dart.dev/).


  **gnostic** reads OpenAPI descriptions into these generated data structures,

  reports errors, resolves internal dependencies, and writes the results in a

  binary form that can be used in any language that is supported by the Protocol

  Buffer tools. A plugin interface simplifies integration with API tools written

  in a variety of different languages, and when necessary, Protocol Buffer

  OpenAPI descriptions can be reexported as JSON or YAML.


  **gnostic** compilation code and OpenAPI Protocol Buffer models are

  automatically generated from an

  [OpenAPI JSON Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json).

  Source code for the generator is in the [generate-gnostic](generate-gnostic)

  directory.


  ## Disclaimer


  Feedback and contributions are welcome! Until there is a 1.0 release, please

  consider this prerelease software and work in progress. To ensure stable

  builds, we request that dependent projects always refer to tagged releases of

  **gnostic**.


  ## Requirements


  **gnostic** can be run in any environment that supports [Go](http://golang.org)

  and the

  [Protocol Buffer Compiler](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).


  ## Installation and Getting Started


  The following instructions are for installing **gnostic** using

  [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules), supported by Go 1.11

  and later.


  1.  Get this package by downloading it with `git clone`.

          git clone https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic
          cd gnostic

  2.  Verify that you have a local installation of `protoc`. You can get protoc
      [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

  3.  Build **gnostic** with `make`. This uses
      [go generate](https://blog.golang.org/generate) to build support code
      including code generated by `protoc` and the Go protoc plugin, which is
      automatically downloaded from
      [github.com/golang/protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) by the
      [COMPILE-PROTOS.sh](COMPILE-PROTOS.sh) script. This also builds all plugins
      and associated tools in this repo.

  4.  Verify **gnostic** with `make test`. These tests are run by **gnostic**'s
      continuous integration, so you should expect them to pass for all release
      versions.

  5.  Run **gnostic**. This sample invocation creates a file in the current
      directory named `petstore.pb` that contains a binary Protocol Buffer
      description of a sample API.

              gnostic --pb-out=. examples/v2.0/json/petstore.json

  6.  You can also compile files that you specify with a URL. Here's another way
      to compile the previous example. This time we're creating `petstore.text`,
      which contains a textual representation of the Protocol Buffer description.
      This is mainly for use in testing and debugging.

              gnostic --text-out=petstore.text https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleapis/gnostic/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore.json

  7.  For a sample application, see apps/report. This reads a binary Protocol
      Buffer encoding created by **gnostic**.

          go install ./apps/report ## automatically installed by the top-level Makefile
          report petstore.pb

  8.  **gnostic** also supports plugins. **gnostic**'s plugin interface is
      modeled on `protoc`'s
      [plugin.proto](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.proto)
      and is described in [plugins/plugin.proto](plugins/plugin.proto). Several
      plugins are implemented in the `plugins` directory. Others, like
      [gnostic-grpc](https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic-grpc) and
      [gnostic-go-generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic-go-generator),
      are published in their own repositories. One such plugin is
      [gnostic-vocabulary](plugins/gnostic-vocabulary), which produces a summary
      of the word usage in an APIs interfaces. You can run `gnostic-vocabulary`
      with the following:

              gnostic examples/v2.0/json/petstore.json --vocabulary_out=.

      This will produce files named `vocabulary.pb` and `vocabulary.json` in
      `examples/v2.0/json`. For the format of `vocabulary.pb`, see
      [metrics/vocabulary.proto](metrics/vocabulary.proto).

  9.  [Optional] A large part of **gnostic** is automatically-generated by the
      [generate-gnostic](generate-gnostic) tool. This uses JSON schemas to
      generate Protocol Buffer language files that describe supported API
      specification formats and Go-language files of code that will read JSON or
      YAML API descriptions into the generated protocol buffer models.
      Pre-generated versions of these files are checked into the
      [openapiv2](openapiv2), [openapiv3](openapiv3), and [discovery](discovery)
      directories. You can regenerate this code with the following:

          go install ./generate-gnostic
          generate-gnostic --v2
          generate-gnostic --v3
          generate-gnostic --discovery

  A python client for [Swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) enabled REST API. It wouldn't be easier to

  try Swagger REST API by [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui). However, when it's time to **unittest**

  your API, the first option you find would be [Swagger-codegen](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen), but the better option is us.


  This project is developed after [swagger-py](https://github.com/digium/swagger-py), which is a nicely implemented one, and inspired many aspects of this project. Another project is [flex](https://github.com/pipermerriam/flex), which focuses on parameter validation, try it if you can handle other parts by yourselves. For other projects related to Swagger tools in python, check [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec#python).


  **pyswagger** is much easier to use (compared to swagger-codegen, you don't need to prepare a scala environment) and tries hard to **fully supports** [Swagger Spec](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) in all aspects.

  ## Quick Start


  Before running this script, please make sure [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) is installed on your environment.


  ```python

  from pyswagger import App, Security

  from pyswagger.contrib.client.requests import Client

  from pyswagger.utils import jp_compose


  # load Swagger resource file into App object

  app = App._create_('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json')


  auth = Security(app)

  auth.update_with('api_key', '12312312312312312313q') # api key

  auth.update_with('petstore_auth', '12334546556521123fsfss') # oauth2


  # init swagger client

  client = Client(auth)


  # a dict is enough for representing a Model in Swagger

  pet_Tom=dict(id=1, name='Tom', photoUrls=['http://test']) 

  # a request to create a new pet

  client.request(app.op['addPet'](body=pet_Tom))


  # - access an Operation object via App.op when operationId is defined

  # - a request to get the pet back

  req, resp = app.op['getPetById'](petId=1)

  # prefer json as response

  req.produce('application/json')

  pet = client.request((req, resp)).data

  assert pet.id == 1

  assert pet.name == 'Tom'


  # new ways to get Operation object corresponding to 'getPetById'.

  # 'jp_compose' stands for JSON-Pointer composition

  req, resp = app.resolve(jp_compose('/pet/{petId}', base='#/paths')).get(petId=1)

  req.produce('application/json')

  pet = client.request((req, resp)).data

  assert pet.id == 1

  ```


  ---------


  ## Installation

  We support pip installtion.

  ```bash

  pip install pyswagger

  ```


  Additional dependencies must be prepared before firing a request. If you are going to access a remote/local web server, you must install [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) first.

  ```bash

  pip install requests

  ```


  If you want to test a local tornado server, please make sure tornado is ready on your environment

  ``` bash

  pip install tornado

  ```


  We also provide native client for flask app, but to use it, flask is also required

  ``` bash

  pip install flask

  ```

  ## Deployment


  ### TL;DR


  ```html

  <!DOCTYPE html>

  <html>
    <head>
      <title>ReDoc</title>
      <!-- needed for adaptive design -->
      <meta charset="utf-8"/>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:300,400,700|Roboto:300,400,700" rel="stylesheet">

      <!--
      ReDoc doesn't change outer page styles
      -->
      <style>
        body {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <redoc spec-url='http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json'></redoc>
      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/redoc@next/bundles/redoc.standalone.js"> </script>
    </body>
  </html>

  ```

  That's all folks!


  **IMPORTANT NOTE:** if you work with untrusted user spec, use `untrusted-spec` [option](#redoc-options-object) to prevent XSS security risks.


  ### 1. Install ReDoc (skip this step for CDN)

  Install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

      yarn add redoc

  or using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm):

      npm install redoc --save

  ### 2. Reference redoc script in HTML

  For **CDN**:

  ```html

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/redoc/bundles/redoc.standalone.js"> </script>

  ```


  For npm:

  ```html

  <script src="node_modules/redoc/bundles/redoc.standalone.js"> </script>

  ```


  ### 3. Add `<redoc>` element to your page

  ```html

  <redoc spec-url="url/to/your/spec"></redoc>

  ```


  ### 4. Enjoy :smile:



  ## Usage as a React component


  Install peer dependencies required by ReDoc if you don't have them installed already:

      npm i react react-dom mobx@^4.2.0 styled-components

  Import `RedocStandalone` component from 'redoc' module:


  ```js

  import { RedocStandalone } from 'redoc';

  ```


  and use it somewhere in your component:


  ```js

  <RedocStandalone specUrl="url/to/your/spec"/>

  ```


  or


  ```js

  <RedocStandalone spec={/* spec as an object */}/>

  ```


  Also you can pass options:


  ```js

  <RedocStandalone
    specUrl="http://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI/openapi.json"
    options={{
      nativeScrollbars: true,
      theme: { colors: { primary: { main: '#dd5522' } } },
    }}
  />

  ```


  Here are detailed [options docs](#redoc-options-object).


  You can also specify `onLoaded` callback which will be called each time Redoc has been fully rendered or when error occurs (with an error as the first argument). *NOTE*: It may be called multiply times if you change component properties


  ```js

  <RedocStandalone
    specUrl="http://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI/openapi.json"
    onLoaded={error => {
      if (!error) {
        console.log('Yay!');
      }
    }}
  />

  ```


  [**IE11 Support Notes**](docs/usage-with-ie11.md)


  ## The Docker way


  ReDoc is available as pre-built Docker image in official [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/redocly/redoc/). You may simply pull & run it:

      docker pull redocly/redoc
      docker run -p 8080:80 redocly/redoc

  Also you may rewrite some predefined environment variables defined in [Dockerfile](./config/docker/Dockerfile). By default ReDoc starts with demo Petstore spec located at `http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json`, but you may change this URL using environment variable `SPEC_URL`:

      docker run -p 8080:80 -e SPEC_URL=https://api.example.com/openapi.json redocly/redoc

  ## ReDoc CLI


  [See here](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/cli/README.md)


  ## Configuration


  ### Security Definition location

  You can inject Security Definitions widget into any place of your specification `description`. Check out details [here](docs/security-definitions-injection.md).


  ### Swagger vendor extensions

  ReDoc makes use of the following [vendor extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specificationExtensions):

  * [`x-logo`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-logo) - is used to specify API logo

  * [`x-traitTag`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-traitTag) - useful for handling out common things like Pagination, Rate-Limits, etc

  * [`x-code-samples`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-code-samples) - specify operation code samples

  * [`x-examples`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-examples) - specify JSON example for requests

  * [`x-nullable`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#nullable) - mark schema param as a nullable

  * [`x-displayName`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-displayname) - specify human-friendly names for the menu categories

  * [`x-tagGroups`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-tagGroups) - group tags by categories in the side menu

  * [`x-servers`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-servers) - ability to specify different servers for API (backported from OpenAPI 3.0)

  * [`x-ignoredHeaderParameters`](docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-ignoredHeaderParameters) - ability to specify header parameter names to ignore


  ### `<redoc>` options object

  You can use all of the following options with standalone version on <redoc> tag by kebab-casing them, e.g. `scrollYOffset` becomes `scroll-y-offset` and `expandResponses` becomes `expand-responses`.


  * `untrustedSpec` - if set, the spec is considered untrusted and all HTML/markdown is sanitized to prevent XSS. **Disabled by default** for performance reasons. **Enable this option if you work with untrusted user data!**

  * `scrollYOffset` - If set, specifies a vertical scroll-offset. This is often useful when there are fixed positioned elements at the top of the page, such as navbars, headers etc;

  `scrollYOffset` can be specified in various ways:
    * **number**: A fixed number of pixels to be used as offset;
    * **selector**: selector of the element to be used for specifying the offset. The distance from the top of the page to the element's bottom will be used as offset;
    * **function**: A getter function. Must return a number representing the offset (in pixels);
  * `suppressWarnings` - if set, warnings are not rendered at the top of documentation (they still are logged to the console).

  * `lazyRendering` - _Not implemented yet_ ~~if set, enables lazy rendering mode in ReDoc. This mode is useful for APIs with big number of operations (e.g. > 50). In this mode ReDoc shows initial screen ASAP and then renders the rest operations asynchronously while showing progress bar on the top. Check out the [demo](\\redocly.github.io/redoc) for the example.~~

  * `hideHostname` - if set, the protocol and hostname is not shown in the operation definition.

  * `expandResponses` - specify which responses to expand by default by response codes. Values should be passed as comma-separated list without spaces e.g. `expandResponses="200,201"`. Special value `"all"` expands all responses by default. Be careful: this option can slow-down documentation rendering time.

  * `requiredPropsFirst` - show required properties first ordered in the same order as in `required` array.

  * `sortPropsAlphabetically` - sort properties alphabetically

  * `showExtensions` - show vendor extensions ("x-" fields). Extensions used by ReDoc are ignored. Can be boolean or an array of `string` with names of extensions to display

  * `noAutoAuth` - do not inject Authentication section automatically

  * `pathInMiddlePanel` - show path link and HTTP verb in the middle panel instead of the right one

  * `hideLoading` - do not show loading animation. Useful for small docs

  * `nativeScrollbars` - use native scrollbar for sidemenu instead of perfect-scroll (scrolling performance optimization for big specs)

  * `hideDownloadButton` - do not show "Download" spec button. **THIS DOESN'T MAKE YOUR SPEC PRIVATE**, it just hides the button.

  * `disableSearch` - disable search indexing and search box

  * `onlyRequiredInSamples` - shows only required fields in request samples.

  * `theme` - ReDoc theme. Not documented yet. For details check source code: [theme.ts](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/src/theme.ts)


  ## Advanced usage of standalone version

  Instead of adding `spec-url` attribute to the `<redoc>` element you can initialize ReDoc via globally exposed `Redoc` object:

  ```js

  Redoc.init(specOrSpecUrl, options, element, callback?)

  ```


  - `specOrSpecUrl` is either JSON object with specification or an URL to the spec in `JSON` or `YAML` format

  - `options` [options object](#redoc-options-object)

  - `element` DOM element to put ReDoc into

  - `callback` (optional) - callback to be called after Redoc has been fully rendered. It is also called also on errors with error as the first argument


  ```js

  Redoc.init('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json', {
    scrollYOffset: 50
  }, document.getElementById('redoc-container'))

  ```

  ![Widdershins screenshot](https://mermade.github.io/widdershins/screenshot.png)


  ### News


  * Version 4.0 changes:
    * Now uses Promises not callbacks
    * Option to output html directly, and to ReSpec format
    * Unified JavaScript and Node.js code-samples, PHP added
    * `restrictions` column (`readOnly`/`writeOnly`) added to schema templates
    * Numerous bug fixes
  * As of v3.0.0 Widdershins no longer expands the definition of OpenAPI body parameters / requestBodies by default, unless they have an inline schema. You can restore the old behaviour by using the `--expandBody` option.

  * You may limit the depth of schema examples using the `--maxDepth` option. The default is 10.

  * To omit schemas entirely, please copy and customise the `main.dot` template.

  * As of v3.1.0 Widdershins includes a generated `Authorization` header in OpenAPI code samples. If you wish to omit this, see [here](/templates/openapi3/README.md).


  ### To install


  * Clone the git repository, and `npm i` to install dependencies, or

  * `npm install [-g] widdershins` to install globally


  ### Getting started


  Widdershins is generally used as a stage in an API documentation pipeline. The pipeline begins with an API definition in OpenAPI 3.x, OpenAPI 2.0 (fka Swagger), API Blueprint, AsyncAPI or Semoasa format. Widdershins converts this description into markdown suitable for use by a **renderer**, such as [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), [Shins](https://github.com/mermade/shins) or html suitable for use with [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec).


  If you need to create your input API definition, [this list of available editors](https://apis.guru/awesome-openapi3/category.html#editors) may be useful.


  More in-depth documentation is [available here](https://mermade.github.io/widdershins).


  ### Examples


  ```

  node widdershins --search false --language_tabs 'ruby:Ruby' 'python:Python' --summary defs/petstore3.json -o petstore3.md

  ```


  ### Options


  | CLI parameter name | JavaScript parameter name | Type | Default value | Description |

  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

  | --customApiKeyValue | options.customApiKeyValue | `string` | `ApiKey` | Set a custom API key value to use as the API key in generated code examples. |

  | --expandBody | options.expandBody | `boolean` | `false` | If a method's requestBody parameter refers to a schema by reference (not with a inline schema), by default, Widdershins shows only a reference to this parameter. Set this option to true to expand the schema and show all properties in the request body. |

  | --headings | options.headings | `integer` | 2 | Set the value of the `headingLevel` parameter in the header so Shins knows how many heading levels to show in the table of contents. Currently supported only by Shins, not by Slate, which lacks this feature. |

  | --omitBody | options.omitBody | `boolean` | `false` | By default, Widdershins includes the body parameter as a row in the parameters table before the rows that represent the fields in the body. Set this parameter to omit that body parameter row. |

  | --omitHeader | options.omitHeader | `boolean` | `false` | Omit the header / YAML front-matter in the generated Markdown file. |

  | --resolve | options.resolve | `boolean` | `false` | Resolve external $refs, using the `source` parameter or the input file as the base location. |

  | --shallowSchemas | options.shallowSchemas | `boolean` | `false` | When referring to a schema with a $ref, don't show the full contents of the schema. |

  | N/A | options.source | `string` | None | The absolute location or URL of the source file to use as the base to resolve relative references ($refs) from; required if options.resolve is set to true. For CLI commands, Widdershins uses the input file as the base for the $refs. |

  | --summary | options.tocSummary | `boolean` | `false` | Use the operation summary as the TOC entry instead of the ID. |

  | --useBodyName | options.useBodyName | `boolean` | Use original param name for OpenAPI 2.0 body parameter. |

  | -v, --verbose | options.verbose | `boolean` | `false` | Increase verbosity. |

  | -h, --help | options.help | `boolean` | `false` | Show help. |

  | --version | options.version | `boolean` | `false` | Show version number. |

  | -c, --code | options.codeSamples | `boolean` | `false` | Omit generated code samples. |

  | --httpsnippet | options.httpsnippet | `boolean` | `false` | Use httpsnippet to generate code samples. |

  | -d, --discovery | options.discovery | `boolean` | `false` | Include schema.org WebAPI discovery data. |

  | -e, --environment | N/A | `string` | None | File to load config options from. |

  | -i, --includes | options.includes | `string` | None | List of files to put in the `include` header of the output Markdown. Processors such as Shins can then import the contents of these files. |

  | -l, --lang | options.lang | `boolean` | `false` | Generate the list of languages for code samples based on the languages used in the source file's `x-code-samples` examples. |

  | --language_tabs | options.language_tabs | `string` | (Differs for each input type) | List of language tabs for code samples using language[:label[:client]] format, such as `javascript:JavaScript:request`. |

  | -m, --maxDepth | options.maxDepth | `integer` | 10 | Maximum depth to show for schema examples. |

  | -o, --outfile | N/A | `string` | None | File to write the output markdown to. If left blank, Widdershins sends the output to stdout. |

  | -r, --raw | options.raw | `boolean` | `false` | Output raw schemas instead of example values. |

  | -s, --search | options.search | `boolean` | `true` | Set the value of the `search` parameter in the header so Markdown processors like Shins include search or not in their output. |

  | -t, --theme | options.theme | `string` | darkula | Syntax-highlighter theme to use. |

  | -u, --user_templates | options.user_templates | `string` | None | Directory to load override templates from. |

  | -x, --experimental | options.experimental | `boolean` |  | For backwards compatibility only; ignored. |

  | -y, --yaml | options.yaml | `boolean` | `false` | Display JSON schemas in YAML format. |

  |  | options.templateCallback | `function` | None | A `function` that is called before and after each template (JavaScript code only). |

  |  | options.toc_footers | `object` | A map of `url`s and `description`s to be added to the ToC footers array (JavaScript code only). |


  In Node.JS code, create an options object and pass it to the Widdershins `convert` function, as in this example:


  ```javascript

  const converter = require('widdershins');

  let options = {}; // defaults shown

  options.codeSamples = true;

  options.httpsnippet = false;

  //options.language_tabs = [];

  //options.language_clients = [];

  //options.loadedFrom = sourceUrl; // only needed if input document is relative

  //options.user_templates = './user_templates';

  options.templateCallback = function(templateName,stage,data) { return data };

  options.theme = 'darkula';

  options.search = true;

  options.sample = true; // set false by --raw

  options.discovery = false;

  options.includes = [];

  options.shallowSchemas = false;

  options.tocSummary = false;

  options.headings = 2;

  options.yaml = false;

  //options.resolve = false;

  //options.source = sourceUrl; // if resolve is true, must be set to full path or URL of the input document

  converter.convert(apiObj,options)

  .then(str => {
    // str contains the converted markdown
  })

  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  });

  ```


  To only include a subset of the pre-defined language-tabs, or to rename their display-names, you can override the `options.language_tabs`:


  ```javascript

  options.language_tabs = [{ 'go': 'Go' }, { 'http': 'HTTP' }, { 'javascript': 'JavaScript' }, { 'javascript--node': 'Node.JS' }, { 'python': 'Python' }, { 'ruby': 'Ruby' }];

  ```


  The `--environment` option specifies a JSON or YAML-formatted `options` object, for example:


  ```json

  {
    "language_tabs": [{ "go": "Go" }, { "http": "HTTP" }, { "javascript": "JavaScript" }, { "javascript--node": "Node.JS" }, { "python": "Python" }, { "ruby": "Ruby" }],
    "verbose": true,
    "tagGroups": [
      {
        "title": "Companies",
        "tags": ["companies"]
      },
      {
        "title": "Billing",
        "tags": ["invoice-create", "invoice-close", "invoice-delete"]
      }
    ]
  }

  ```


  You can also use the environment file to group OAS/Swagger tagged paths together to create a more elegant table of contents, and overall page structure.


  If you need to support a version of Slate \<v1.5.0 (or a renderer which also doesn't support display-names for language-tabs, such as `node-slate`, `slate-node` or `whiteboard`), you can use the `--environment` option with the included `whiteboard_env.json` file to simply achieve this.


  If you are using the `httpsnippet` option to generate code samples, you can specify the client library used to perform the requests for each language by overriding the `options.language_clients`:


  ```javascript

  options.language_clients = [{ 'shell': 'curl' }, { 'node': 'request' }, { 'java': 'unirest' }];

  ```


  If the language name differs between the markdown name required to syntax highlight and the httpsnippet required target, both can be specified in the form `markdown--target`.


  To see the list of languages and clients supported by httpsnippet, [click here](https://github.com/Kong/httpsnippet/tree/master/src/targets).


  The `loadedFrom` option is only needed where the OpenAPI / Swagger definition does not specify a host, and (as per the OpenAPI [specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#fixed-fields)) the API endpoint is deemed to be based on the source URL

  the definition was loaded from.


  To see the list of highlight-js syntax highlighting themes, [click here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).


  Schema.org WebAPI discovery data is included if the `discovery` option above is set `true`. See the W3C [WebAPI Discovery Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/web-api-discovery/) for more information.


  ## Language tabs


  Widdershins supports the `x-code-samples` [vendor-extension](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#operation-object-vendor-extensions) to completely customise your documentation. Alternatively, you can edit the default code-samples in the `templates` sub-directory, or override them using the `user_templates` option to specify a directory containing your templates.


  Widdershins supports the use of multiple language tabs with the same language (i.e. plain Javascript and Node.Js). To use this support you must be using Slate (or one of its ports compatible with) version 1.5.0 or higher. [Shins](https://github.com/mermade/shins) versions track Slate version numbers.


  ## Templates


  By default, Widdershins uses the templates in its `templates/` folder to generate the Markdown output. To customize the templates, copy some or all of them to a folder and pass their location to the `user_templates` parameter.


  The templates include `.dot` templates and `.def` partials. To override a `.dot` template, you must copy it and the child `.def` partials that the template references. Similarly, to override a `.def` partial, you must also copy the parent `.dot` template. For OpenAPI 3, the primary template is `main.dot` and its main child partials are `parameters.def`, `responses.def`, and `callbacks.def`.


  This means that it is usually easiest to copy all `.dot` and `.def` files to your user templates directory so you don't skip a template or partial. To bring in changes from Widdershins updates, you can use a visual `diff` tool which can run across two directories, such as [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/) or [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org).


  ### Template syntax


  Templates are compiled with [doT.js](https://github.com/olado/doT#readme).


  Templates have access to a `data` object with a range of properties based on the document context. For information about the parameters, see the README file for the appropriate templates:


  * [Swagger 2.0 / OpenAPI 3.0.x template parameters](/templates/openapi3/README.md)

  * [AsyncAPI 1.x template parameters](/templates/asyncapi1/README.md)

  * [Semoasa 0.1.0 template parameters](/templates/semoasa/README.md)


  To print the value of a parameter or variable in a template, use the code `{{=parameterName}}`. For example, to print the title of an OpenAPI 3 spec (from its `info.title` field), use the code `{{=data.api.info.title}}`.


  To loop through values in an array, use the code `{{~ arrayName :tempVariable}}` to start the loop and the code `{{~}}` to close the loop. For example, the OpenAPI 3 partial `parameters.def` uses this code to create a table of the parameters in an operation:

  ```

  |Name|In|Type|Required|Description|

  |---|---|---|---|---|

  {{~ data.parameters :p}}|{{=p.name}}|{{=p.in}}|{{=p.safeType}}|{{=p.required}}|{{=p.shortDesc || 'none'}}|

  {{~}}

  ```


  For if/then logic, use the code `{{? booleanExpression}}` to start the code block and the code `{{?}}` to close the block. For example, the OpenAPI 3 `main.dot` template calls the `security.def` partial to show information about the security schemes if the OpenAPI spec includes a `securitySchemes` section:

  ```

  {{? data.api.components && data.api.components.securitySchemes }}

  {{#def.security}}

  {{?}}

  ```


  You can run arbitrary JavaScript within a template by inserting a code block within curly braces. For example, this code creates a variable and references it with normal doT.js syntax later in the template:

  ```

  {{ {

  let message = "Hello!";

  } }}


  {{=message}}

  ```


  ### Template callbacks


  The `templateCallback` parameter points to a function that Widdershins calls before and after each template runs. The callback function receives a `data` object that contains the spec that Widdershins is processing; the function must return this object. You can use callback functions only if you are calling Widdershins from JavaScript code, not from the command line.


  Widdershins passes these variables to the callback function:

  - `templateName`: The name of the template, such as `main`.

  - `stage`: Whether Widdershins is calling the callback function before (`pre`) or after (`post`) the template.

  - `data`: An object that contains the data that Widdershins is processing. You can mutate the `data` object in any way you see fit, but the function must return it whether it changes it or not. Content that you put in the `data.append` property is appended to the current output stream.


  For example, this JavaScript code prints the name of the template and the processing stage in the output Markdown:

  ```javascript

  'use strict';


  const converter = require('widdershins');

  const fs = require('fs');


  let options = {};

  options.templateCallback = myCallBackFunction;


  function myCallBackFunction(templateName, stage, data) {
    let statusString = "Template name: " + templateName + "\n";
    statusString += "Stage: " + stage + "\n";
    data.append = statusString;
    return data;
  }


  const apiObj = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('defs/petstore3.json'));


  converter.convert(apiObj, options)

  .then(str => {
    fs.writeFileSync('petstore3Output.md', str, 'utf8');
  });

  ```


  ## Tests


  To run a test-suite:


  ```

  node testRunner {path-to-APIs}

  ```


  The test harness currently expects `.yaml` or `.json` files and has been tested against


  * [APIs.guru](https://github.com/APIs-guru/OpenAPI-directory)

  ## Who?

  You! Hello.  Do you need to write or contribute to an OpenAPI definition?  If so, read on...


  ## What?

  We recommend a docs-like-code approach to OpenAPI definitions:

  - Write it using your favorite text-editor or IDE (we love VSCode).

  - Organize it into multiple files and folders to make it easy to navigate.

  - Store it using source control (such as GitHub).

  - Continuously validate it using our free [openapi-cli tool](https://github.com/redocly/openapi-cli) or our free continuous validation service (coming soon).

  - Bundle it (for a smaller footprint to use in other tools or for tools that do not support a multi-file format).


  ## Why?

  There are a few advantages in hosting your API definition on GitHub:
   - Community engagement (PR's and issues -- if you have a public repo)
   - Advertisment in the GitHub community
   - Hosting on GitHub pages (perfect uptime, CDN, Jekyll, custom domains with CNAME)
   - Revision history, branching, CI
   - Review and approval workflows using Pull Requests
   - Fast on-boarding time (developers and tech writers know how to use GitHub :smile:)
   - Fully compatible with Redocly API Reference too

   There are also some advantages to a multi-file YAML format OpenAPI definition:
   - Reuse schema objects to keep things DRY (don't repeat yourself) 
   - Smaller diffs compared to JSON (especially for markdown descriptions)
   - Easier to navigate
   - Easier to edit with confidence

  ## Features

  This generator helps to create a GitHub repo with the following features:
   - Split a big (or small) OpenAPI definition into smaller files organized into folders
   - Bundle it into a single file for deployment
   - Continuous integration/deployment on Travis or Redocly Workflows
   - Code samples as separate files
   - Automate deployment of your OpenAPI definition and docs
   - OpenAPI definition is validated after each commit
   - Live editing in your editor of choice :heart_eyes:

  ## Structure


  You will have a structure similar to this:

  ```
      ├── .redocly.yaml
      ├── LICENSE
      ├── README.md
      ├── docs
      │   ├── favicon.png
      │   └── index.html
      ├── openapi
      │   ├── README.md
      │   ├── code_samples
      │   │   ├── C#
      │   │   │   └── echo
      │   │   │       └── post.cs
      │   │   ├── PHP
      │   │   │   └── echo
      │   │   │       └── post.php
      │   │   └── README.md
      │   ├── components
      │   │   └── README.md
      │   └── paths
      │       └── README.md
      └── package.json
  ```


  However, you can adjust it to any structure you prefer.


  The `openapi` folder is where your OpenAPI definition will live.  Inside there, and the sub-folders, there are `README.md` files to help guide you further. This is also where your entrypoint `openapi.yaml` will live.


  The `components` folder is where you will organize sub-folders such as `schema` to define your schema.


  The `paths` folder is where you will organize your paths. There will be a 'README.md' file in there with suggestions for how to organize it into specially named files (or folders) that use an `@` in place of a `/` (because files cannot have a `/` character in them).  You will also be able to use path parameters by wrapping them in curly braces `{example}`.


  The `.redocly.yaml` file is a universal configuration for various Redocly tools including the lint tool and reference doc engine.


  ## Commands


  The generated repository includes installing a dependency for our `openapi-cli` tool which supports commands such as `validate`, `bundle`, and more.  There are scripted shortcuts defined in the repository's `package.json`.  



  ## Examples of generated repositories

  - https://github.com/Rebilly/RebillyAPI

  - https://github.com/thingful/openapi-spec

  - https://github.com/TwineHealth/TwineDeveloperDocs


  ## How to generate your repository


  We assume you already have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.


  - Install `create-openapi-repo` globally:

  ```bash

  npm install -g create-openapi-repo

  ```

  or use [`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b):


  We'll use `npx` in this example.  However, remove `npx` if you installed it globally.


  ```bash

  npx create-openapi-repo

  ```


  You will be presented with some questions. You can create a new definition or use an existing definition to initialize your project.


  Please note, if you do start a new one, remember to [create a GitHub repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#create-a-new-repository-on-github) where your OpenAPI definition will live.


  If you use the prior version of this generated repository, please read the following upgrade instructions.


  #### Upgrading from a prior version


  Migrate your repository from a previous structure of OpenAPI repo to this newer structure with our migration tool. 


  Run this in the root folder of your repo.


  ```bash

  npx create-openapi-repo --migrate-2-3

  ```


  Note: the migration tool does not migrate plugins automatically. You would need to manually add them to the `transformers` folder.

  # The apicurio-studio project (Open Source API Design Studio)


  ## Summary


  This is the official Git repository for the apicurio studio project:  http://www.apicur.io/


  The apicurio studio project is a standalone API design studio that can be used to create

  new or edit existing API designs (using the OpenAPI specification).


  ## Get the code


  The easiest way to get started with the code is to [create your own fork](http://help.github.com/forking/)

  of this repository, and then clone your fork:

  ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:<you>/apicurio-studio.git
    $ cd apicurio-studio
    $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio.git
  ```

  At any time, you can pull changes from the upstream and merge them onto your master:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout master               # switches to the 'master' branch
    $ git pull upstream master          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/master' onto your 'master' branch
    $ git push origin                   # pushes all the updates to your fork, which should be in-sync with 'upstream'
  ```

  The general idea is to keep your 'master' branch in-sync with the 'upstream/master'.


  ## Building apicurio-studio


  ### Requirements

  - Maven 3.x

  - Java 8+


  The following command compiles all the code, installs the JARs into your local Maven repository, and runs all of the unit tests:

  ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
  ```

  ## Quickstart (i.e. How To Run It)


  The fastest way to get started using Apicurio Studio is to use the quickstart.  The Apicurio quickstart is produced as part 

  of the full maven build - you can find it in `distro/quickstart/target` as a ZIP file.  To start up the quickstart, use the 

  following commands from the top-level of the repository:


  ```bash
    $ rm -rf ./distro/quickstart/target/apicurio-studio-*-SNAPSHOT
    $ unzip distro/quickstart/target/apicurio-studio-*-quickstart.zip -d distro/quickstart/target
    $ ./distro/quickstart/target/apicurio-studio-*-SNAPSHOT/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-apicurio.xml
  ```


  This will start Wildfly on your local machine and you can access the UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


  ## Contribute fixes and features


  Apicurio Studio is open source, and we welcome anybody who wants to participate and contribute!


  Please follow [Setting your development environment](https://apicurio-studio.readme.io/docs/setting-up-a-development-environment) guide to setup your local machine for development.  The guide assumes the use of the Eclipse IDE for Java

  development (backend) but is not required - developers should be able to adapt the instructions to their particular

  environment.


  If you want to fix a bug or make any changes, please [log an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio/issues) describing the bug

  or new feature. Then we highly recommend making the changes on a topic branch named with the JIRA issue number. For example, this command creates

  a branch for the APISTUDIO-1234 issue:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout -b apicurio-studio-1234
  ```

  After you're happy with your changes and a full build (with unit tests) runs successfully, commit your

  changes on your topic branch. Then it's time to check for and pull any recent changes that were made in

  the official repository:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout master               # switches to the 'master' branch
    $ git pull upstream master          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/master' onto your 'master' branch
    $ git checkout apicurio-studio-1234   # switches to your topic branch
    $ git rebase master                 # reapplies your changes on top of the latest in master
                                        # (i.e., the latest from master will be the new base for your changes)
  ```

  If the pull grabbed a lot of changes, you should rerun your build to make sure your changes are still good.

  You can then either [create patches](http://progit.org/book/ch5-2.html) (one file per commit, saved in `~/apicurio-studio-1234`) with

  ```bash
    $ git format-patch -M -o ~/apicurio-studio-1234 orgin/master
  ```

  and upload them to the JIRA issue, or you can push your topic branch and its changes into your public fork repository

  ```bash
    $ git push origin apicurio-studio-1234         # pushes your topic branch into your public fork of apicurio-studio
  ```

  and [generate a pull-request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) for your changes.


  We prefer pull-requests, because we can review the proposed changes, comment on them,

  discuss them with you, and likely merge the changes right into the official repository.


  Please try to create one commit per feature or fix, generally the easiest way to do this is via [git squash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits).

  This makes reverting changes easier, and avoids needlessly polluting the repository history with checkpoint commits.


  ## Code Formatting


  When you are hacking on some apicurio-studio code, we'd really appreciate it if you followed the

  apicurio-studio coding standards.  If you're using Eclipse, you can find a code formatter config

  file here:

  ```

  tools/src/eclipse/apicurio-eclipse-formatter.xml

  ```

  You should be able to import that guy straight into Eclipse by going to

  *Window->Preferences :: Java/Code Style/Formatter*
apiacademy/rapido-web: "# rápido-web\r

  \r

  Rapido is an API design tool that facilitates the _sketching_ phase of
  design.  At a minimum, a sketch should be:\r

  \r

  * easy to create\r

  * easy to dispose\r

  * easy to translate into a prototype\r

  \r

  Sketching allows a designer to perform many iterations of an early design if
  the cost of creation is very low.  This promotes experimentation and
  ideation.  Early iterations are important for API design as it is difficult to
  change an API once it is released and being used.\r

  \r

  ## Rapido Design Principles\r

  \r

  1.  Rapid design - a user should be able to create a complete API sketch
  within five minutes\r

  2.  Safe Disposability - users should feel safe when starting a design over
  (through archiving and peristence of previous designs )\r

  3.  Unidirectional - Rapido sketches can be exported to later lifecycle
  stages, but designs cannot be imported.  \r

  \r

  ## Development Setup\r

  \r

  Rapido requires NodeJS and npm and a [backend
  Rapido](http://github.com/apiacademy/rapido-backend) implementation.\r

  \r

  To install:\r

  `npm install`\r

  \r

  To start:\r

  `npm start`\r

  \r

  To test with Chrome:\r

  'npm test'\r\n"

  OpenAPI-GUI

  ===========


  OpenAPI-GUI is a GUI for creating and editing OpenAPI version 3.0.x JSON/YAML definitions. In its current form it is most useful as a tool for starting off and editing simple OpenAPI definitions. Imported OpenAPI 2.0 definitions are automatically converted to v3.0.


  ![Screenshot](https://github.com/Mermade/openapi-gui/blob/master/img/screenshot.png?raw=true)


  For the previous Swagger / OpenAPI 2.0-only version see [here](https://mikeralphson.github.io/openapi-gui). This version is currently **unmaintained** apart from security fixes.


  This project was initially a fork of [Daryl Kuhn's IODoctor](https://github.com/darrylkuhn/iodoctor/tree/angular-port), which in turn was inspired by [IODoctor by Brandon West](https://github.com/brandonmwest/iodoctor) which was written in Ruby. The complete history of the project is maintained on GitHub.


  Description

  -----------

  ### How It Works


  Select an existing OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0.x definition to upload, or create a new definition and start adding Paths, Operations, and Parameters. When an existing definition is used, it is parsed and forms for editing each Path, Operation and Parameter will be created.


  You can load an existing definition by appending a `?url=` query parameter to the initial start page.


  Click an item from the menu on the left to begin editing. View the JSON/YAML output at any time by selecting one of the "Export" tabs. When finished, download the output to save it locally or copy it your clipboard. OpenAPI-GUI only stores one definition at a time, and this is in your browser's local-storage. Make sure you save your JSON/YAML output locally.


  Before performing a destructive action, OpenAPI-GUI saves the current state of the definition. At all other times you must remember to select Save manually.


  ### Technology


  OpenAPI-GUI runs entirely client-side using a number of Javascript frameworks including [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) for CSS.


  To get the app up and running just browse to [the live version on GitHub pages](https://mermade.github.io/openapi-gui), deploy a clone to GitHub pages, deploy to Heroku using the button below, or clone the repo and point a browser at `index.html` or host it yourself - couldn't be simpler. More [technical information here](docs/technical.md).


  You only need to `npm install` the Node.js modules if you wish to use the `openapi-gui` embedded web server (i.e. not if you are running your own web-server), otherwise they are only there for PaaS deployments.


  [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


  #### CLI options


  ```

  -d, --definition    serve the given OAS definition

  -l, --launch        start a web-browser pointing to the GUI

  -p, --port          specify the port to run on, defaults to $PORT or 3000

  -w, --write         enable writing back to the source definition

  ```


  #### Running with Docker


  If you don't have a local Node development environment, or if you would prefer to run OpenAPI-GUI in a Docker container, you can do in with a few simple steps:


  1. Clone the repository.

  2. Run `docker build -t mermade/openapi-gui .` to build the Docker image (`mermade/openapi-gui`)

  3. Run `docker run --name openapi-gui -p 8080:3000 -d mermade/openapi-gui` to run the server on port 8080.

  4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your favorite browser.

  5. When you're done, shut down the server by running `docker stop openapi-gui && docker rm openapi-gui`


  Or you can pull the pre-built Docker image:


  * `docker pull mermade/openapi-gui`


  ### Limitations


  * OpenAPI-GUI will de-reference shared parameters.

  * The definition must be self-contained with no external `$ref`s. **This is likely to be resolved (ho-ho) soon**.

  * Editing a response / example / body schema will dereference it.

  * OpenAPI-GUI will not always preserve vendor-extensions, e.g. if a parameter is deleted and recreated.

  * OpenAPI-GUI will not preserve comments from definitions imported in YAML format.

  - Bundle multiple Swagger/OpenAPI files into one combined file




  Related Projects

  --------------------------

  - [Swagger Parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-parser)

  - [Swagger Express Middleware](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware)




  Installation

  --------------------------

  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):


  ```bash

  npm install -g @apidevtools/swagger-cli

  ```




  Usage

  --------------------------


  ```

  swagger-cli <command> [options] <file>


  Commands:
      validate                Validates an API definition in Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 format

      bundle                  Bundles a multi-file API definition into a single file

  Options:
      -h, --help              Show help for any command
      -v, --version           Output the CLI version number
      -d, --debug [filter]    Show debug output, optionally filtered (e.g. "*", "swagger:*", etc.)
  ```



  ### Validate an API


  The `swagger-cli validate` command will validate your Swagger/OpenAPI definition against the [Swagger 2.0 schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json) or [OpenAPI 3.0 Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.json).  It also performs additional validations against the [specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md), which will catch some things that aren't covered by the schema, such as duplicate parameters, invalid MIME types, etc.


  The command will exit with a non-zero code if the API is invalid.


  ```

  swagger-cli validate [options] <file>


  Options:
      --no-schema             Do NOT validate against the Swagger/OpenAPI JSON schema

      --no-spec               Do NOT validate against the Swagger/OpenAPI specification
  ```


  #### Git pre-commit hook


  There is a useful Python tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) that can be used to execute a wide suite of pre-commit checks. The `swagger-cli validate` command can be integrated as part of a git pre-commit hook by adding the following configuration to the `repos` entry of an existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.


  ```

  -   repo: https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-cli
      rev: v2.2.1
      hooks:
      - id: swagger-validation
        args: ["validate", "<path to root swagger>"]
  ```


  The intention is to point to single root swagger that references multiple swagger definitions. The above hook will execute the `swagger-cli validation` against the root swagger anytime that a file matching the pattern `.*swagger.*\.(json|yaml|yml)` is modified. Any failures in this validation will prevent the git commit from being processed.


  ### Combine Multiple Files


  The Swagger and OpenAPI specs allows you to split your API definition across multiple files using [`$ref` pointers](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#reference-object) to reference each file. You can use the `swagger-cli bundle` command to combine all of those referenced files into a single file, which is useful for distribution or interoperation with other tools.


  By default, the `swagger-cli bundle` command tries to keep the output file size as small as possible, by only embedding each referenced file _once_.  If the same file is referenced multiple times, then any subsequent references are simply modified to point to the _single_ inlined copy of the file.  If you want to produce a bundled file without _any_ `$ref` pointers, then add the `--dereference` option.  This will result in a larger file size, since multiple references to the same file will result in that file being embedded multiple times.


  If you don't specify the `--output-file` option, then the bundled API will be written to stdout, which means you can pipe it to other commands.


  The result of this method by default is written as JSON. It can be changed to YAML with the `--type` option, by passing the `yaml` value.


  ```

  swagger-cli bundle [options] <file>


  Options:
      -o, --outfile <file>        The output file

      -r, --dereference           Fully dereference all $ref pointers

      -f, --format <spaces>       Formats the output using the given number of spaces
                                  (the default is 2 spaces)

      -t, --type <filetype>       Defines the output file type. The valid values are: json, yaml
                                  (the default is JSON)

      -w, --wrap <column>         Set the line length for YAML strings
                                  (the default is no wrapping)
  ```

  The **OpenAPI.NET** SDK contains a useful object model for OpenAPI documents
  in .NET along with common serializers to extract raw OpenAPI JSON and YAML
  documents from the model.\r

  \r

  **See more information on the OpenAPI specification and its history here: <a
  href=\"https://www.openapis.org\">Open API Initiative</a>**\r

  \r

  Project Objectives \r

  \r

  - Provide a single shared object model in .NET for OpenAPI descriptions.\r

  - Include the most primitive Reader for ingesting OpenAPI JSON and YAML
  documents in both V2 and V3 formats.\r

  - Provide OpenAPI description writers for both V2 and V3 specification
  formats.\r

  - Enable developers to create Readers that translate different data formats
  into OpenAPI descriptions. \r

  \r

  # Installation\r

  \r

  - Install core Nuget package `Microsoft.OpenApi`\r

  - Install readers Nuget package `Microsoft.OpenApi.Readers`\r

  \r

  # Processors\r

  The OpenAPI.NET project holds the base object model for representing OpenAPI
  documents as .NET objects. Some developers have found the need to write
  processors that convert other data formats into this OpenAPI.NET object model.
  We'd like to curate that list of processors in this section of the readme. \r

  \r

  The base JSON and YAML processors are built into this project. Below is the
  list of the other supported processor projects.\r

  \r

  - [**C# Comment / Annotation
  Processor**](https://github.com/Microsoft/OpenAPI.NET.CSharpAnnotations) :
  Converts standard .NET annotations ( /// comments ) emitted from your build
  (MSBuild.exe) into OpenAPI.NET document object. \r

  \r

  - [**OData CSDL Processor**](https://github.com/Microsoft/OpenAPI.NET.OData)
  : Converts the XML representation of the Entity Data Model (EDM) describing an
  OData Service into OpenAPI.NET document object. \r

  \r

  ## Build the image


  This is only required if you want to try new changes in the Dockerfile of this project.


  ```bash

  docker build -t local-openapi-diff .

  ```


  You can replace the local image name `local-openapi-diff` by any name of your choice.


  ## Run an instance


  In this example the `$(pwd)/core/src/test/resources` directory is mounted in the `/specs` directory of the container

  in readonly mode (`ro`).


  ```bash

  docker run -t \
    -v $(pwd)/core/src/test/resources:/specs:ro \
    joschi/openapi-diff /specs/path_1.yaml /specs/path_2.yaml
  ```


  The remote name `joschi/openapi-diff` can be replaced with `local-openapi-diff` or the name you gave to your local image.


  # Usage


  openapi-diff can read OpenAPI specs from JSON files or HTTP URLs.


  ## Command Line


  ```bash

  $ openapi-diff --help

      e.printStackTrace();
  }

  ```


  #### Markdown


  ```java

  String render = new MarkdownRender().render(diff);

  try {
      FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(
              "testDiff.md");
      fw.write(render);
      fw.close();


























































































































































































































































      
  } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }

  ```


  ### Extensions


  This project uses Java Service Provider Inteface (SPI) so additional extensions can be added. 


  To build your own extension, you simply need to create a `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.qdesrame.openapi.diff.core.compare.ExtensionDiff` file with the full classname of your implementation.  Your class must also implement the `com.qdesrame.openapi.diff.core.compare.ExtensionDiff` interface.  Then, including your library with the `openapi-diff` module will cause it to be triggered automatically.

  # openapi-filter


  ![ci](https://github.com/Mermade/openapi-filter/workflows/ci/badge.svg)


  Filter internal paths, operations, parameters, schemas etc from OpenAPI/Swagger/AsyncAPI definitions.


  Simply flag any object within the definition with an `x-internal` specification extension, and it will be removed from the output.


  For example:


  ```yaml

  openapi: 3.0.0

  info:
    title: API
    version: 1.0.0
  paths:
    /:
      get:
        x-internal: true
        ...
  ```


  Works with OpenAPI/Swagger 2.0 and 3.0.x and AsyncAPI definitions.


  ```

  openapi-filter.js <infile> [outfile]


  Positionals:
    infile   the input file
    outfile  the output file

  Options:

    --info           include complete info object with --valid           [boolean]
    --inverse, -i    output filtered elements only                       [boolean]
    --flags, -f      flags to filter by          [array] [default: ["x-internal"]]
    --flagValues, -v flag String values to match             [array] [default: []]
    --checkTags      filter if flags given in --flags are in the tags array
                                                                         [boolean]
    --overrides, -o  prefixes used to override named properties[arr] [default: []]
    --valid          try to ensure inverse output is valid               [boolean]
    --strip, -s      strip the flags from the finished product           [boolean]
    --servers        include complete servers object with --valid        [boolean]
    --lineWidth, -l  max line width of yaml output           [number] [default: 0]
    --maxAliasCount  maximum YAML aliases allowed          [number] [default: 100]
    --configFile     The file & path for the filter options                 [path]
    --help           Show help                                           [boolean]
    --verbose        Output more details of the filter process             [count]
  ```


  use `--` to separate flags or other array options from following options, i.e.:


  `openapi-filter --flags x-private x-hidden -- source.yaml target.yaml`


  or


  ```javascript

  let openapiFilter = require('openapi-filter');

  let options = {}; // defaults are shown

  //options.inverse = false;

  //options.valid = false;

  //options.flags = ['x-internal'];

  let res = openapiFilter.filter(obj,options);

  ```

    -p, --path             the path to extract                            [string]
    -o, --operationid      the operationIds to extract                     [array]
    -m, --method           the method to extract for the given path       [string]
    -i, --info             copy full info object, otherwise minimal      [boolean]
    -d, --removeDocs       remove all externalDocs properties            [boolean]
    -r, --removeExamples   remove all example/examples properties        [boolean]
    -x, --removeExtensions remove all x- extension properties            [boolean]
    -s, --security         include security information                  [boolean]
    -v, --verbose          increase verbosity                            [boolean]

  or


  ```javascript

  const openapiExtractor = require('openapi-extract');

  const options = {};

  // options.path = '...';

  // options.method = '...';

  // options.operationid = ['...'];

  const res = openapiExtractor.extract(obj, options);


  const map = openapiExtractor.shard(obj, options);

  ```


  The `options` object takes the same values as the CLI, for these keys and default values:


  *   path = ''

  *   method = ''

  *   info = false

  *   openai = false

  *   removeDocs = false

  *   removeExamples = false

  *   removeExtensions = false

  *   server = false

  *   security = false

  *   operationid = []


  ## OpenAI compliant mode


  This option turns on the following rules:

  Git Repository and the Branches

  -------------------------------


  1. Most stable and recent version is at the `master` branch, previous versions are in the version branches such
     as `v4`, `v3`, `v2`, and `v1`.

  2. Version branch with the current version such as `v5` is used for building up the next release. It's documentation may
     not be updated frequently and thus reserved for the daring ones.

  3. Feature branches such as `features/html` and `features/router` are purely for experimentation purpose to try out a
     feature. They may be merged when ready.

  Test Drive

  ----------


  Install this repository to try out the examples.


  > Make sure PHP 5.4 or above is available on your server. We recommended using the latest version for better performance.


  ### 1. Install Composer


  Restler uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. First, download a copy of `composer.phar`.

  It can be kept in your project folder or ideally in `usr/local/bin` to use it globally for all your projects. If you are

  on Windows, you can use the composer

  [windows installer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) instead.


  ### 2. Install Restler


  #### Option 1. Using composer create-project


  You may install Restler by running the create project command in your terminal. Replace {projectName} with your actual

  project name. It will create a folder with that name and install Restler.


  ```console

  php composer.phar create-project luracast/restler {projectName}

  ```


  > **Note:-**

  >

  > 1. If you do not want the additional formats and BDD tools you can include
       >    `--no-dev` to enforce exclusion of dev packages.
  >

  > 2. If you want to try the bleading edge v3 branch or any of the feature
       >    branches include `3.x-dev` or `dev-features/html` in the above command

  #### Option 2. Downloading from GitHub


  After installing Composer, download the [latest version]() of the Restler framework and extract its contents into a

  directory on your server. Next, in the root of your Restler project, run the `php composer.phar install`

  (or `composer install`) command to install all the framework's dependencies. This process requires Git to be installed

  on the server to successfully complete the installation.


  If you want to update the Restler framework, you may issue the

  `php composer.phar update` command.


  > **Note:-** If you are not allowed to install composer and git on your server, you

  > can install and run them on your development machine. The resulting files and

  > folders can be uploaded and used on the server.


  ### 3. Configure


  Ideally public folder should be mapped as your web root, It is optional, but recommended avoiding exposing unneeded

  files and folders.


  ### 4. Try it out


  Try the live examples in your localhost. 

  > You may launch the PHP's built-in server with `composer serve` command.


  ### 5. Run some test


  Update the base_url specified in `behat.yml` and then try the following command


  ```console


  vendor/bin/behat


  ```

  > alternatively you can run `composer test`


  This will test the examples against the behaviors expected, for example


  ```gherkin


  Feature: Testing CRUD Example

    Scenario: Creating new Author with JSON
      Given that I want to make a new "Author"
      And his "name" is "Chris"
      And his "email" is "chris@world.com"
      And the request is sent as JSON
      When I request "/examples/_007_crud/authors"
      Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be JSON
      And the response has a "id" property

  ```


  All set, Happy RESTling! :)


  Quick Start Guide

  -----------------


  We have two options to create your own restler api server

   1. Most convenient option is using application templates such as [Restler Application](https://github.com/Luracast/Restler-Framework) 
      which has integrations with many packages to help us with the business logic as well. 
      If you choose this option, select a branch in that repository and proceed with 
      the instructions available there.
      
   2. Create a project from scratch so that you have full control over every aspect of your application. 
      If you choose this option, follow along with the steps below.
      - create a folder to hold your project and open it in the terminal.
      - run `composer init` and follow along to create `composer.json`
      - when it is asking for dependencies, type `restler/framework` and `^5` for the version constraint.
      - alternatively, you can leave it blank and create the composer.json first and then run `composer require restler/framework:^5`

      
  > we are using `restler/framework` instead of `luracast/restler` to reduce the space required for the package. 

  > It is coming from https://github.com/Luracast/Restler-Framework it contains only the contents of src folder here.
      
  > Even when you are building from scratch, checking out the application templates will help with folder structure 

  > decisions and finding other useful packages.


  ### 1. Write API


  Create your **API classes** with all needed public and protected methods


  ### 2. Open the Gateway


  Create the **gateway (public/index.php)** as follows


  ```php

  <?php

  require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';


  use Luracast\Restler\Restler;


  $r = new Restler();

  $r->addAPIClass('YourApiClassNameHere'); // repeat for more

  $r->handle(); //serve the response

  ```


  ### 3. Prettify URLs


  **Enable URL Rewriting**


  Make sure all the requests go to index.php by enabling URL Rewriting for your website


  For example:-


  If you are on Apache, you can use an .htaccess file such as


  ```apache

  DirectoryIndex index.php

  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteRule ^$ index.php [QSA,L]
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
      RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
  </IfModule>

  <IfModule mod_php5.c>
      php_flag display_errors On
  </IfModule>

  ```


  > **Note:-** This requires `AllowOverride` to be set to `All` instead of `None`

  > in the `httpd.conf` file, and might require some tweaking on some server

  > configurations. Refer to [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html)

  > documentation for more info.


  If you are on Nginx, you have to make sure you set the `server_name` and pass the PHP scripts to fast cgi (PHP-FPM)

  listening on 127.0.0.1:9000


  ```

  server {
      listen        80;
      server_name   api.luracast.com; //change it to match your server name

      //... other stuff

      location ~ \.php$ {
          root           /var/www/html;
          fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
          fastcgi_index  index.php;
          fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /var/www/html/$fastcgi_script_name;
          include        fastcgi_params;
      }

      //... other stuff
  }

  ```


  > **Note:-** This requires PHP, PHP-FPM to be properly installed and configured.

  > Refer to [PHP FastCGI](http://wiki.nginx.org/PHPFcgiExample) example for more

  > info.


  ### 4. Customise


  **Fine tune to suit your needs**


  ```php

  <?php

  require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

  use Luracast\Restler\Restler;

  use Luracast\Restler\Defaults;

  //set the defaults to match your requirements

  Defaults::$throttle = 20; //time in milliseconds for bandwidth throttling

  //setup restler

  $r = new Restler();

  $r->addAPIClass('YourApiClassNameHere'); // repeat for more

  $r->addAPIClass('Explorer'); //from restler framework for API Explorer

  $r->addFilterClass('RateLimit'); //Add Filters as needed

  $r->handle(); //serve the response

  ```


  Explore the api and try it out by openings `explorer/index.html` from the web root on your browser


  Happy Exploring! :)


  > **Note:-** Using eAccelerator can make restler to fail as it removes the

  > comments. More info can be found [here](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/eaccelerator-and-doctrine-2)


  ### 5. Annotate


  Restler supports annotations in the form of PHPDoc comments for API fine tuning


  They are documented in detail under [Annotations](ANNOTATIONS.md)


  ### 6. Authorize


  In order to protect your api, authenticate and allow valid users


  ```php

  <?php

  require_once '../restler.php';

  use Luracast\Restler\Restler;

  $r = new Restler();

  $r->addAPIClass('YourApiClassNameHere'); // repeat for more

  $r->addAuthenticationClass('CustomAuth'); //Add Authentication classes as needed

  $r->handle(); //serve the response

  ```


  ### 7. Start Production


  By default Restler runs in debug mode more fine tuned for API developer, by showing detailed error messages and

  prettifying the api result to human readbale form


  By turning on production mode you will gain some performance boost as it will cache the routes (comment parsing happens

  only once instead of every api call), few other files and avoid giving out debug information


  ```php

  <?php

  require_once '../restler.php';

  use Luracast\Restler\Restler;


  //setup restler


  $r = new Restler(true); //turn on production mode by passing true.

  //If you are using file based cache (the default) make sure cache folder is

  //writable. when you make changes to your code make sure you delete the

  // routes.php inside the cache folder

  //...

  ```

  >*Note:-* When production mode is set to `true` it always uses the cache and does not detect 

  > changes and new routes if any. Your continuous integration pipeline or your git hook should delete 

  > this file during the deployment process. Alternatively you can pass second parameter to restler

  > constructor to refresh the cache when changes need to be applied.


  Change Log

  ----------


  ### Restler 5


  * Semantic versioning to move forward

  * Support for PHP 8

  * Corrects the source path to be outside the vendor directory

  * Adds php development server support with `composer serve` command.

  * Ability to run the tests with `composer test` command after running the server 
    with `composer serve` in another window.

  ### Restler 3.0 RC6


  #### What's new


  * Adds PassThrough class to serve files outside your web root, including secure downloads

  * Adds Explorer class (v1 swagger 1.2 spec, and v2 swagger 2.0 spec) as a potential 
    replacement to Resources class (swagger 1.1 spec)
      * Explorer comes bundled with the html, css, and assets. So that you need not manually download and configure it
      * Explorer combines the parameters that are expected in the request body to create a unique model for swagger
      * Since Restler Explorer comes bundled, you can map to it to your url of choice. 
        For example `$restler->addAPIClass("Luracast/Restler/Explorer", 'swagger')` maps it to `/swagger`.
      * Explorer metadata can be easily customized with ExplorerInfo class

  #### Improvements


  * Routes class improved to provide a findAll method to list all the routes for a specific version of the API excluding
    the specified paths and http methods.
  * The magic properties utilized by routes when found, ignoring actual properties. 
    This is useful for Dynamic Model classes such as Eloquent.
  * Routes now allow `@required` and `@properties` to be arrays when the parameter is an object. 
    This helps us to pick and choose the properties for each api method differently.
    Example `{@properties property1,property2,property3}` `{@required property1,property2}` makes an api to only look for
    3 properties and 2 of them are required.

  * Optimized the Nav class. It now makes use of `Routes::findAll()`, along with Explorer class

  * Restler class has setBaseUrls method to set acceptable base urls that can be set using `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`.
    Read [this article](http://shiflett.org/blog/2006/mar/server-name-versus-http-host) to understand why. This is useful
    in the following cases when
      * PHP has trouble detecting the port correctly
      * multiple domains are pointing to the same server

  * Restler class now allows overriding the status code by setting `$this->restler->responseCode` from the api method.

  * Improved Forms class to send the embedded properties to emmet template. For example


  ```

  /**
   * {@id form1}
   *
   * @param string $name
   * @param int $age
  */

  ```

    Generates the following form

      <form role="form" id="form1" method="POST" ...

    because the emmet template has id in it (see below)

      form[role=form id=$id# name=$name# method=$method# action=$action# enctype=$enctype#]

  * Forms class uses embedded properties with `@param` comments to set html attributes (for example id, accept etc) easily

  * FormStyles improved.

  * Validator is now initialized by scope so that we can set its properties with `@class` comment. **Example:
    -**  `@class Validator {@holdException}` makes the validator to hold the exceptions instead of throwing
  * Improved Form validation with error messages for individual fields.

  * Forms example updated to show validation errors with bootstrap based themes.

  * CommentParser is now able to parse `@property`, `@property-read`, `@property-write` to support documenting the dynamic
    properties.
  * CommentParser supports short array syntax such as `string[]`, `DateTime[]`

  * Scope adds support for external DI Container of your choice with `Scope::$resolver` property.

  * Renamed `String` class to `Text` for PHP 7 support (String is a reserved keyword in php7)

  * Flash now implements ArrayAccess so that we can access flash variables just like an array

  * **composer.json**: removed many dependencies from require-dev. Will prompt the developers to install them individually
    when they need them.
  * newrelic support added.

  * Memcache support added.

KevM/fubumvc-swagger: "FubuMVC Swagger\r

  ===============\r

  \r

  This project helps your [FubuMVC](https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc)
  web application\r

  \ generate API documentation via [Swagger](http://swagger.wordnik.com/).\r

  \ \r

  [![swagger
  demo](https://github.com/KevM/fubumvc-swagger/raw/gh-pages/images/hellofubusw\
  agger.png)](http://fubuswagger.apphb.com/)\r

  \r

  See our [Hello Swagger](http://fubuswagger.apphb.com/) live demo.\r

  \r

  ### How do I get it? ###\r

  \r

  We have a [nuget package](https://nuget.org/packages/FubuMVC.Swagger)
  available.\r

  \r

  ```PM> Install-Package FubuMVC.Swagger```\r

  \r

  #### Building Swagger\r

  \r

  To build just run rake grabbing the albacore gem if you don't already have
  it. \r

  \r

  ```rb\r

  gem install albacore\r

  rake\r

  ```\r

  \r

  ### How do I put this in my peanut butter?\r

  \r

  **Note:** This should all be simplified when I find the time to figure out
  Fubu Bottles. \r

  \r

  Your API documented should support content negitiation and be grouped under
  the route **/api**. Take a look at the
  [HelloSwagger](https://github.com/KevM/fubumvc-swagger/tree/master/src/HelloS\
  wagger) for examples. \r

  \r

  #### Checklist\r

  \r

  Add a reference to this project. Why not [use
  nuget](https://nuget.org/packages/FubuMVC.Swagger)!\r

  \r

  Add the following to your FubuRegistry:\r

  \r

  ```cs\r

  ApplyConvention<SwaggerConvention>();\r

  Services(s=> s.AddService<IActionGrouper, APIRouteGrouper>());\r

  ```\r

  \r

  Copy the swagger-ui directory into your **/content** direcotry.\r

  \r

  Launch your web app and take a look at the **/api** to see if it is
  working.\r

  \r

  ### What does this convention do?\r

  \r

  Three routes will be added to your application:\r

  \r

  ```html\r

  GET /api\r

  ```\r

  This route serves up the Swagger-UI page currently embedded into
  FubuSwagger. _This part needs work._\r

  \r

  ```html\r

  GET /api/resources.json\r

  ```\r

  Swagger UI does some resource discovery and uses the output of this route to
  find all of the API groups in your project. \r

  \r

  ```html\r

  GET /api/{GroupKey}.json\r

  ```\r

  Details of each API group present in your app. \r

  \r

  Pointing a Swagger UI web site at ```http://localhost:port/api/``` should
  render pretty API documentation for your web application.\r

  \r

  ### Why do I not see documentation for my actions?\r

  \r

  Make sure the actions you wish to document are enabled for \"Conneg\"\r

  \r

  In this example I have two marker interfaces which are used to mark input
  models on actions which will be APIs. \r

  \r

  ```cs\r

  graph.Behaviors\r

  \ .Where(x => x.InputType().CanBeCastTo<IApi>() ||
  x.InputType().CanBeCastTo<IUnauthenticatedApi>())\r

  \ .Each(x => x.MakeAsymmetricJson());\r

  ```\r

  \r

  This example will force the result of these actions to be JSON. Note: This
  configuration is working around a bug in FubuMVC where normal browser usage
  will return XML for Conneg enabled endpoints. :( \r

  \r

  Better yet take a look at the
  [HelloSwagger](https://github.com/KevM/fubumvc-swagger/tree/master/src/HelloS\
  wagger) demo application and see how it is wired up and organized.\r

  \r

  ### How do I add more detail to my APIs\r

  \r

  You can use data annotations to mark up your input models and their
  properties.\r

  \r

  ```cs\r

  [Description(\"Workflow object history\")]\r

  public class HistoryRequest : IApi \r

  {\r

  \    [Required, Description(\"Type of workflow object. Typically this is
  'case'.\")]\r

  \    [AllowableValues(\"case\", \"subcase\", \"solution\", \"<any workflow
  object name>\")]\r

  \    public string Type { get; set; }\r

  \    [Required, Description(\"Id of the workflow object.\")]\r

  \    public string Id { get; set; }\r

  \r

  \    [Description(\"Limit the amout of history returned the given number of
  days. When this parameter is not specified. All history items will be
  returned.\")]\r

  \tpublic int DaysOfHistory { get; set; }\r

  }\r

  ```"

  ## Installation


  You can add the module to your Hapi using npm:


  ```bash

  > npm install hapi-swagger --save

  ```


  **hapi-swagger** no longer bundles `joi` to fix [#648](https://github.com/hapi-swagger/hapi-swagger/issues/648). Install **hapi-swagger** with peer dependencies using:


  ```bash

  npx install-peerdeps hapi-swagger

  ```


  If you want to view the documentation from your API you will also need to install the `inert` and `vision` plugs-ins which support templates and static

  content serving.


  ```bash

  > npm install @hapi/inert --save

  > npm install @hapi/vision --save

  ```


  ## Documentation


  -   [Options Reference](optionsreference.md)

  -   [Usage Guide](usageguide.md)


  ## Quick start


  In your Hapi apps please check the main JavaScript file and add the following code to already created a Hapi `server` object.

  You will also add the routes for you API as describe on [hapi website](https://hapi.dev/).


  ```Javascript

  const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');

  const Inert = require('@hapi/inert');

  const Vision = require('@hapi/vision');

  const HapiSwagger = require('hapi-swagger');

  const Pack = require('./package');


  (async () => {
      const server = Hapi.server({
          port: 3000,
          host: 'localhost'
      });

      const swaggerOptions = {
          info: {
                  title: 'Test API Documentation',
                  version: Pack.version,
              },
          };

      await server.register([
          Inert,
          Vision,
          {
              plugin: HapiSwagger,
              options: swaggerOptions
          }
      ]);

      try {
          await server.start();
          console.log('Server running at:', server.info.uri);
      } catch(err) {
          console.log(err);
      }

      server.route(Routes);
  })();

  ```


  ### Tagging your API routes


  As a project may be a mixture of web pages and API endpoints you need to tag the routes you wish Swagger to

  document. Simply add the `tags: ['api']` property to the route object for any endpoint you want documenting.


  You can even specify more tags and then later generate tag-specific documentation. If you specify

  `tags: ['api', 'foo']`, you can later use `/documentation?tags=foo` to load the documentation on the

  HTML page (see next section).


  ```Javascript

  {
      method: 'GET',
      path: '/todo/{id}/',
      options: {
          handler: handlers.getToDo,
          description: 'Get todo',
          notes: 'Returns a todo item by the id passed in the path',
          tags: ['api'], // ADD THIS TAG
          validate: {
              params: Joi.object({
                  id : Joi.number()
                          .required()
                          .description('the id for the todo item'),
              })
          }
      },
  }

  ```


  Once you have tagged your routes start the application. **The plugin adds a page into your site with the route `/documentation`**,

  so the the full URL for the above options would be `http://localhost:3000/documentation`.


  ### Typescript


  **hapi-swagger** exports its own typescript definition file that can be used when registering the plugin with **Hapi**. See example below:


  #### Install Typescript Definition Files


  ```sh

  npm i @types/hapi__hapi @types/hapi__inert @types/hapi__joi @types/hapi__vision @types/node hapi-swagger --save-dev

  ```


  #### Register Plugin with Typescript


  ```typescript

  import * as Hapi from '@hapi/hapi';

  import * as HapiSwagger from 'hapi-swagger';


  // code omitted for brevity


  const swaggerOptions: HapiSwagger.RegisterOptions = {
      info: {
          title: 'Test API Documentation'
      }
  };


  const plugins: Array<Hapi.ServerRegisterPluginObject<any>> = [
      {
          plugin: Inert
      },
      {
          plugin: Vision
      },
      {
          plugin: HapiSwagger,
          options: swaggerOptions
      }
  ];


  await server.register(plugins);

  ```

  ## Thanks


  I would like to thank all that have contributed to the project over the last couple of years. This is a hard project to maintain, getting Hapi to work with Swagger is like putting a round plug in a square hole. Without the help of others it would not be possible.

  ```


  # octohipster [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/myfreeweb/octohipster.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/myfreeweb/octohipster) [![unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/un-license-green.svg?style=flat)](http://unlicense.org)


  Octohipster is


  - a REST library/toolkit/microframework for Clojure

  - that allows you to build HTTP APIs

  - in a declarative [Webmachine](https://github.com/basho/webmachine/wiki/Overview)-like style, using [Liberator](https://github.com/clojure-liberator/liberator)

  - powered by [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring); you can add [rate limiting](https://github.com/myfreeweb/ring-ratelimit), [authentication](https://github.com/cemerick/friend), [metrics](http://metrics-clojure.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ring.html), [URL rewriting](https://github.com/ebaxt/ring-rewrite) and more with just middleware


  It allows you to make APIs that


  - support hypermedia ([HAL+JSON](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html), [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/) and Link/Link-Template HTTP headers; works with [Frenetic](http://dlindahl.github.com/frenetic/))

  - support multiple output formats (JSON, EDN, YAML and any custom format)

  - have [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki) documentation 

  - use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) for validation *and* documentation

  - have pagination


  ## Concepts


  - a **resource** is a single endpoint that accepts requests and returns responses

  - a **group** is a collection of resources with a single URL prefix (eg. a group /things contains resources /things/ and /things/{id}) and zero or more shared properties (usually the schema)

  - a **documenter** is a function that returns a resource which documents regular resources (Swagger, HAL root, etc)

  - a **mixin** is a function that is applied to multiple resources to give them shared behavior (eg. collection or entry behavior)

  - a **response handler** is a function that is used to encode response data to a particular content-type (JSON, EDN, YAML, etc.)

  - a **params handler** is a function that is used to decode incoming data from a particular content-type (JSON, EDN, YAML, etc.)


  ## Usage


  ```clojure

  (ns example
    (:use [octohipster core routes mixins pagination]
          [octohipster.documenters swagger schema]
          org.httpkit.server)
    (:import org.bson.types.ObjectId)
    (:require [monger.core :as mg]
              [monger.query :as mq]
              [monger.collection :as mc]
              monger.json))

  (mg/connect!)

  (mg/set-db! (mg/get-db "octohipster-example"))


  ;;;; The "model"

  ;;;;  tip: make it a separate namespace, eg. app.models.contact

  (def contact-schema
    {:id "Contact"
     :type "object"
     :properties {:name {:type "string"}
                  :phone {:type "integer"}}
     :required [:name]})

  (defn contacts-count [] (mc/count "contacts"))

  (defn contacts-all []
    (mq/with-collection "contacts"
      (mq/find {})
      (mq/skip *skip*)
      (mq/limit *limit*)))
  (defn contacts-find-by-id [x] (mc/find-map-by-id "contacts" (ObjectId. x)))

  (defn contacts-insert! [x]
    (let [id (ObjectId.)]
      (mc/insert "contacts" (assoc x :_id id))
      (mc/find-map-by-id "contacts" id)))
  (defn contacts-update! [x old] (mc/update "contacts" old x :multi false))

  (defn contacts-delete! [x] (mc/remove "contacts" x))


  ;;;; The resources

  ;; with shared pieces of documentation

  (def name-param
    {:name "name", :dataType "string", :paramType "path", :required "true", :description "The name of the contact", :allowMultiple false})

  (def body-param
    {:dataType "Contact", :paramType "body", :required true, :allowMultiple false})

  (defresource contact-collection
    :desc "Operations with multiple contacts"
    :mixins [collection-resource]
    :clinks {:item ::contact-item}
    :data-key :contacts
    :exists? (fn [ctx] {:contacts (contacts-all)})
    :post! (fn [ctx] {:item (-> ctx :request :non-query-params contacts-insert!)})
    :count (fn [req] (contacts-count))
    :doc {:get {:nickname "getContacts", :summary "Get all contacts"}
          :post {:nickname "createContact", :summary "Create a contact"}})

  (defresource contact-item
    :desc "Operations with individual contacts"
    :url "/{_id}"
    :mixins [item-resource]
    :clinks {:collection ::contact-collection}
    :data-key :contact
    :exists? (fn [ctx]
               (if-let [doc (-> ctx :request :route-params :_id contacts-find-by-id)]
                 {:contact doc}))
    :put! (fn [ctx]
            (-> ctx :request :non-query-params (contacts-update! (:contact ctx)))
            {:contact (-> ctx :request :route-params :_id contacts-find-by-id)})
    :delete! (fn [ctx]
               (-> ctx :contact contacts-delete!)
               {:contact nil})
    :doc {:get {:nickname "getContact", :summary "Get a contact", :parameters [name-param]}
          :put {:nickname "updateContact", :summary "Overwrite a contact", :parameters [name-param body-param]}
          :delete {:nickname "deleteContact", :summary "Delete a contact", :parameters [name-param]}})

  ;;;; The group

  (defgroup contact-group
    :url "/contacts"
    :add-to-resources {:schema contact-schema}  ; instead of typing the same for all resources in the group
    :resources [contact-collection contact-item])

  ;;;; The handler

  (defroutes site
    :groups [contact-group]
    :documenters [schema-doc schema-root-doc swagger-doc swagger-root-doc])

  (defn -main [] (run-server site {:port 8080}))

  ```

DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc: "# Building FubuMVC\r

  \r

  The FubuMVC codebase still uses Rake for build automation, but as of
  September 2015, you don't **have** to use Rake to develop with FubuMVC if you
  don't want to. You **will need \r

  to have Node.js or Io.js and npm installed** in order to build the client
  side assets for FubuMVC's diagnostics package before working with the C#
  code.\r

  \r

  ## With Rake\r

  \r

  Assuming you have Ruby 2.1+ installed on your computer, go to a command line
  and type...\r

  \r

  1. bundle install\r

  1. rake\r

  \r

  \r

  ## Visual Studio.Net Only\r

  \r

  There is a small command file called `build.cmd` that can be executed once
  to bring down nuget and npm dependencies and build the client side assets that
  FubuMVC \r

  needs for its embedded. diagnostics. Run this command at least once before
  opening Visual Studio.Net.\r

  \r

  From there, open the solution file at `src/FubuMVC.sln` and go to town.\r

  \r

  \r

  # Working with Storyteller\r

  \r

  * `rake open_st` -- Opens the Storyteller test suite in the Storyteller
  client for interactive editing and execution\r

  * `rake storyteller` -- Runs all the Storyteller specifications\r

  \r

  # Working with Diagnostics\r

  \r

  Open the diagnostics harness application to the browser with the command
  `rake diagnostics`. This command will start webpack in a new window against
  the client side\r

  attributes in the `javascript` folder in \"watched\" mode. This command also
  compiles and starts the `DiagnosticsHarness` application in a NOWIN server
  before opening a browser\r

  window to the newly launched application. The browser will auto-refresh
  whenever a new version of the webpack `bundle.js` file is saved. You will have
  to stop and restart\r

  the FubuMVC application to see any changes to the server side.\r

  \ \r

  \r\n"

  # Got Swag?


  A tool to test Swagger-powered APIs automatically through monkey testing.

  Also allows for custom tests written directly in Swagger files

  or in separate test suites.

  Includes command-line and programmatic interfaces.

  Install via `npm install got-swag -g`.


  ## Usage


  ```

  got-swag <url> ... [-m] [-t <ms>] [-T] [-v] [-w]
    Test a Swagger URL or file (YAML). Additional files are merged.

  Options:
    -m, --monkey        Run monkey tests on GET endpoints
    -l, --monkey-limit  Maximum number of parameter combinations for each
                        monkey GET, default is 50
    -t, --timeout <ms>  Set a timeout (in milliseconds) for test step execution,
                        default is 2000 ms
    -T, --trace         Trace: Log requests and responses
    -V, --version       Show version
    -w, --watch         Watch the Swagger files and rerun tests on changes
  ```


  Most Mocha options are valid. See https://mochajs.org/#usage for details.



  ## Monkey Testing


  The most basic usage of `got-swag` is monkey testing:

  Each GET endpoint of a service is validated using minimal variable

  input, if any, and the definitions from the services' Swagger file.

  The endpoints are requested with random authentication/variable combinations

  until one combination leads to a response status code less than 400.


  Just invoke got-swag on a URL with the `-m` switch:


  ```

  got-swag http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json -m

  ```


  See [monkeystore.yaml](examples/monkeystore.yaml) for an example of input variables.



  ## Custom Tests


  Additionally, `got-swag` allows to embed custom tests in Swagger files

  or separate test suites.

  The test steps are written in JS using a small domain-specific language.

  Every step is evaluated, even if a previous step failed.


  For example, see [petstore.yaml](examples/petstore.yaml) (embedded) and

  [yoda.yaml](examples/yoda.yaml) (separate).



  ## Test Syntax Reference


  ### [Assertions](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html)


  - `ok( actual )`

  - `equal( actual, expected )`

  - `notEqual( actual, expected )`

  - `deepEqual( actual, expected )`

  - `notDeepEqual( actual, expected )`

  - `strictEqual( actual, expected )`

  - `notStrictEqual( actual, expected )`

  - `deepStrictEqual( actual, expected )`

  - `notDeepStrictEqual( actual, expected )`

  - `match( actualString, expectedPattern )`


  ### Validation


  - `validate( data, schema )`
    - Validate JSON data against a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/)
    - If `data` or `schema` are omitted (strictly equal to `undefined`),
      the last response is validated against the current operation's response schema

  ### Requests


  - `request( options )`
    - Requests the current endpoint
    - `options` is optional, see [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
    - `options.data` sets the request body
  - Shortcuts:
    - `get( url, headers )`
    - `post( url, data, headers )`
    - `put( url, data, headers )`
    - `delete( url, headers )`
    - `options( url, headers )`
    - `head( url, headers )`
    - Use `null` for `url` to request the current endpoint
    - `headers` are optional

  ### Authentication


  - `auth( securityDefinitionId, credentials, scopes )`
    - Authenticates against a security definition
    - `scopes` are optional and inferred from the API if possible

  ### Utility


  - `encodeURIComponent( s )` encodes a string for URI transmission

  - `log( value )` logs a value

  - `stringify( value )` alias of JSON.stringify

  - `parse( string )` alias of JSON.parse

  - `byteLength( string )` alias of Buffer.byteLength for computing 'Content-Length' header manually 

  - `monkeyAuth()` tries to authenticate using known method/credentials

  - `monkeyGet()` tries to GET using known parameters


  ### Variables


  - `vars`: Variables reusable for all tests
    - You can write to `vars` in test steps, see example
  - `req`: Last request data

  - `res`: Last response data
    - `res.statusCode`: Integer response status code
    - `res.headers`: Response headers
    - `res.body`: String response body
    - `res.json`: Parsed JSON response, if any
  - `api`: Complete Swagger API


  ### Extension Syntax


  You can define extension Swagger files on top of existing Swagger files

  using the `'#/path': value` syntax.

  For reference, see [extended-petstore.yaml](examples/extended-petstore.yaml).



  ## Programmatic Usage


  ```js

  var gotSwag = require( 'got-swag' );


  // test api and report as JSON

  gotSwag.test( 'swag.yaml', 'vars.yaml' ).then( function ( report ) {
    console.log( report );
  } );


  // describe mocha tests in current suite

  describe( 'My test suite', function () {
    gotSwag.describe( 'swag.yaml', 'vars.yaml', { parent: this } );
  } );

  ```



  ## Notes


  - Currently, `got-swag` only supports JSON

  - The DSL is sandboxed using [vm](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html)

  - If you see something like
    `.../node_modules/got-swag/lib/validate.js:24 throw new Error( result.errors );`
    in your console, it's a [Node.js Bug](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7397)

domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle: >
  | :mega: Calling for Maintainers |

  |--------------|

  | With the introduction of [ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core), I've now shifted my focus to the Core-specific project - [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore). That will be receiving most of my (already limited) personal time, and so I won't have the capacity to maintain this one at a sufficient rate. Still, I'd love to see it live on and am seeking one or two "core" contributors / maintainers to help out. Ideally, these would be people who have already contributed through PRs and understand the inner workings and overall design. Once signed-up, we can agree on an approach that works - ultimately, I want to remove myself as the bottleneck to merging PRs and getting fresh Nugets published. If you're interested, please let me know by adding a comment [here](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/1053) |


  Swashbuckle

  =========


  [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qoesh4nm6tb6diuk?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/domaindrivendev/swashbuckle)


  Seamlessly adds a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) to WebApi projects! Combines ApiExplorer and Swagger/swagger-ui to provide a rich discovery, documentation and playground experience to your API consumers.


  In addition to its Swagger generator, Swashbuckle also contains an embedded version of [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) which it will automatically serve up once Swashbuckle is installed. This means you can complement your API with a slick discovery UI to assist consumers with their integration efforts. Best of all, it requires minimal coding and maintenance, allowing you to focus on building an awesome API!


  And that's not all ...


  Once you have a Web API that can describe itself in Swagger, you've opened the treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be targeted to a wide range of popular platforms. See [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for more details.


  **Swashbuckle Core Features:**


  * Auto-generated [Swagger 2.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)

  * Seamless integration of swagger-ui

  * Reflection-based Schema generation for describing API types

  * Extensibility hooks for customizing the generated Swagger doc

  * Extensibility hooks for customizing the swagger-ui

  * Out-of-the-box support for leveraging Xml comments

  * Support for describing ApiKey, Basic Auth and OAuth2 schemes ... including UI support for the Implicit OAuth2 flow


  **Swashbuckle 5.0**


  Swashbuckle 5.0 makes the transition to Swagger 2.0. The 2.0 schema is significantly different to its predecessor (1.2) and, as a result, the Swashbuckle config interface has undergone yet another overhaul. Checkout the [transition guide](#transitioning-to-swashbuckle-50) if you're upgrading from a prior version.


  ## Getting Started ##


  There are currently two Nuget packages - the Core library (Swashbuckle.Core) and a convenience package (Swashbuckle)  - that provides automatic bootstrapping. The latter is only applicable to regular IIS hosted Web APIs. For all other hosting environments, you should only install the Core library and then follow the instructions below to manually enable the Swagger routes.


  Once installed and enabled, you should be able to browse the following Swagger docs and UI endpoints respectively:


  ***\<your-root-url\>/swagger/docs/v1***


  ***\<your-root-url\>/swagger***


  ### IIS Hosted ###


  If your service is hosted in IIS, you can start exposing Swagger docs and a corresponding swagger-ui by simply installing the following Nuget package:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle

  This will add a reference to Swashbuckle.Core and also install a bootstrapper (App_Start/SwaggerConfig.cs) that enables the Swagger routes on app start-up using [WebActivatorEx](https://github.com/davidebbo/WebActivator).


  ### Self-hosted ###


  If your service is self-hosted, just install the Core library:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle.Core

  Then manually enable the Swagger docs and, optionally, the swagger-ui by invoking the following extension methods (in namespace Swashbuckle.Application) on an instance of HttpConfiguration (e.g. in Program.cs)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
       .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  ### OWIN  ###


  If your service is hosted using OWIN middleware, just install the Core library:

      Install-Package Swashbuckle.Core

  Then manually enable the Swagger docs and swagger-ui by invoking the extension methods (in namespace Swashbuckle.Application) on an instance of HttpConfiguration (e.g. in Startup.cs)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi();    
  ```


  ## Troubleshooting ##


  Troubleshooting??? I thought this was all supposed to be "seamless"? OK you've called me out! Things shouldn't go wrong, but if they do, take a look at the [FAQs](#troubleshooting-and-faqs) for inspiration.


  ## Customizing the Generated Swagger Docs ##


  The following snippet demonstrates the minimum configuration required to get the Swagger docs and swagger-ui up and running:

  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
        .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  These methods expose a range of configuration and extensibility options that you can pick and choose from, combining the convenience of sensible defaults with the flexibility to customize where you see fit. Read on to learn more.


  ### Custom Routes ###


  The default route templates for the Swagger docs and swagger-ui are "swagger/docs/{apiVersion}" and "swagger/ui/{\*assetPath}" respectively. You're free to change these so long as the provided templates include the relevant route parameters - {apiVersion} and {\*assetPath}.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger("docs/{apiVersion}/swagger", c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi("sandbox/{*assetPath}");
  ```


  In this case the URL to swagger-ui will be `sandbox/index`.


  ### Pretty Print ###


  If you want the output Swagger docs to be indented properly, enable the __PrettyPrint__ option as following:


  ```cs

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.PrettyPrint())
      .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```


  ### Additional Service Metadata ###


  In addition to operation descriptions, Swagger 2.0 includes several properties to describe the service itself. These can all be provided through the configuration API:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.RootUrl(req => GetRootUrlFromAppConfig());

              c.Schemes(new[] { "http", "https" });

              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "Swashbuckle.Dummy")
                  .Description("A sample API for testing and prototyping Swashbuckle features")
                  .TermsOfService("Some terms")
                  .Contact(cc => cc
                      .Name("Some contact")
                      .Url("http://tempuri.org/contact")
                      .Email("some.contact@tempuri.org"))
                  .License(lc => lc
                      .Name("Some License")
                      .Url("http://tempuri.org/license"));
          });
  ```

  #### RootUrl ####


  By default, the service root url is inferred from the request used to access the docs. However, there may be situations (e.g. proxy and load-balanced environments) where this does not resolve correctly. You can workaround this by providing your own code to determine the root URL.


  #### Schemes ####


  If schemes are not explicitly provided in a Swagger 2.0 document, then the scheme used to access the docs is taken as the default. If your API supports multiple schemes and you want to be explicit about them, you can use the __Schemes__ option.


  #### SingleApiVersion ####


  Use this to describe a single version API. Swagger 2.0 includes an "Info" object to hold additional metadata for an API. Version and title are required but you may also provide additional fields as shown above.


  __NOTE__: If your Web API is hosted in IIS, you should avoid using full-stops in the version name (e.g. "1.0"). The full-stop at the tail of the URL will cause IIS to treat it as a static file (i.e. with an extension) and bypass the URL Routing Module and therefore, Web API. 


  ### Describing Multiple API Versions ###


  If your API has multiple versions, use __MultipleApiVersions__ instead of __SingleApiVersion__. In this case, you provide a lambda that tells Swashbuckle which actions should be included in the docs for a given API version. Like __SingleApiVersion__, __Version__ also returns an "Info" builder so you can provide additional metadata per API version.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.MultipleApiVersions(
                  (apiDesc, targetApiVersion) => ResolveVersionSupportByRouteConstraint(apiDesc, targetApiVersion),
                  (vc) =>
                  {
                      vc.Version("v2", "Swashbuckle Dummy API V2");
                      vc.Version("v1", "Swashbuckle Dummy API V1");
                  });
          });
      .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
          {
              c.EnableDiscoveryUrlSelector();
          });
  ```


  \* You can also enable a select box in the swagger-ui (as shown above) that displays a discovery URL for each version. This provides a convenient way for users to browse documentation for different API versions.


  ### Describing Security/Authorization Schemes ###


  You can use BasicAuth, __ApiKey__ or __OAuth2__ options to describe security schemes for the API. See https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md for more details.


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c =>
           {
               //c.BasicAuth("basic")
               //    .Description("Basic HTTP Authentication");

               //c.ApiKey("apiKey")
               //    .Description("API Key Authentication")
               //    .Name("apiKey")
               //    .In("header");

               c.OAuth2("oauth2")
                   .Description("OAuth2 Implicit Grant")
                   .Flow("implicit")
                   .AuthorizationUrl("http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/oauth/dialog")
                   //.TokenUrl("https://tempuri.org/token")
                   .Scopes(scopes =>
                   {
                       scopes.Add("read", "Read access to protected resources");
                       scopes.Add("write", "Write access to protected resources");
                   });

               c.OperationFilter<AssignOAuth2SecurityRequirements>();
           });
       .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
           {
               c.EnableOAuth2Support("test-client-id", "test-realm", "Swagger UI");
           });
  ```

  __NOTE:__ These only define the schemes and need to be coupled with a corresponding "security" property at the document or operation level to indicate which schemes are required for each operation.  To do this, you'll need to implement a custom IDocumentFilter and/or IOperationFilter to set these properties according to your specific authorization implementation


  \* If your API supports the OAuth2 Implicit flow, and you've described it correctly, according to the Swagger 2.0 specification, you can enable UI support as shown above.


  ### Customize the Operation Listing ###


  If necessary, you can ignore obsolete actions and provide custom grouping/sorting strategies for the list of Operations in a Swagger document:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.IgnoreObsoleteActions();

              c.GroupActionsBy(apiDesc => apiDesc.HttpMethod.ToString());

              c.OrderActionGroupsBy(new DescendingAlphabeticComparer());
          });
  ```

  #### IgnoreObsoleteActions ####


  Set this flag to omit operation descriptions for any actions decorated with the Obsolete attribute


  __NOTE__: If you want to omit specific operations but without using the Obsolete attribute, you can create an IDocumentFilter or make use of the built in ApiExplorerSettingsAttribute


  #### GroupActionsBy ####


  Each operation can be assigned one or more tags which are then used by consumers for various reasons. For example, the swagger-ui groups operations according to the first tag of each operation. By default, this will be the controller name but you can use this method to override with any value.


  #### OrderActionGroupsBy ####


  You can also specify a custom sort order for groups (as defined by __GroupActionsBy__) to dictate the order in which operations are listed. For example, if the default grouping is in place (controller name) and you specify a descending alphabetic sort order, then actions from a ProductsController will be listed before those from a CustomersController. This is typically used to customize the order of groupings in the swagger-ui.


  ### Modifying Generated Schemas ###


  Swashbuckle makes a best attempt at generating Swagger compliant JSON schemas for the various types exposed in your API. However, there may be occasions when more control of the output is needed.  This is supported through the following options:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c =>
            {
                c.MapType<ProductType>(() => new Schema { type = "integer", format = "int32" });

                c.SchemaFilter<ApplySchemaVendorExtensions>();

                //c.UseFullTypeNameInSchemaIds();

                c.SchemaId(t => t.FullName.Contains('`') ? t.FullName.Substring(0, t.FullName.IndexOf('`')) : t.FullName);
                
                c.IgnoreObsoleteProperties();

                c.DescribeAllEnumsAsStrings();
            });
  ```


  #### MapType ####


  Use this option to override the Schema generation for a specific type.


  It should be noted that the resulting Schema will be placed "inline" for any applicable Operations. While Swagger 2.0 supports inline definitions for "all" Schema types, the swagger-ui tool does not. It expects "complex" Schemas to be defined separately and referenced. For this reason, you should only use the __MapType__ option when the resulting Schema is a primitive or array type.


  If you need to alter a complex Schema, use a Schema filter.


  #### SchemaFilter ####


  If you want to post-modify "complex" Schemas once they've been generated, across the board or for a specific type, you can wire up one or more Schema filters.


  ISchemaFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(Schema schema, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, Type type);

  ```


  A typical implementation will inspect the system Type and modify the Schema accordingly. If necessary, the schemaRegistry can be used to obtain or register Schemas for other Types


  #### UseFullTypeNamesInSchemaIds ####


  In a Swagger 2.0 document, complex types are typically declared globally and referenced by unique Schema Id. By default, Swashbuckle does NOT use the full type name in Schema Ids. In most cases, this works well because it prevents the "implementation detail" of type namespaces from leaking into your Swagger docs and UI. However, if you have multiple types in your API with the same class name, you'll need to opt out of this behavior to avoid Schema Id conflicts.  


  #### SchemaId ####


  Use this option to provide your own custom strategy for inferring SchemaId's for describing "complex" types in your API.


  #### IgnoreObsoleteProperties ####


  Set this flag to omit schema property descriptions for any type properties decorated with the Obsolete attribute 


  #### DescribeAllEnumsAsStrings ####


  In accordance with the built in JsonSerializer, Swashbuckle will, by default, describe enums as integers. You can change the serializer behavior by configuring the StringEnumConverter globally or for a given enum type. Swashbuckle will honor this change out-of-the-box. However, if you use a different approach to serialize enums as strings, you can also force Swashbuckle to describe them as strings.


  ### Modifying Generated Operations ###


  Similar to Schema filters, Swashbuckle also supports Operation and Document filters:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
           {
               c.OperationFilter<AddDefaultResponse>();

               c.DocumentFilter<ApplyDocumentVendorExtensions>();
           });
  ```

  #### OperationFilter ####


  Post-modify Operation descriptions once they've been generated by wiring up one or more Operation filters.


  IOperationFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription apiDescription);

  ```


  A typical implementation will inspect the ApiDescription and modify the Operation accordingly. If necessary, the schemaRegistry can be used to obtain or register Schemas for Types that are used in the Operation.


  #### DocumentFilter ####


  Post-modify the entire Swagger document by wiring up one or more Document filters.


  IDocumentFilter has the following interface:


  ```csharp

  void Apply(SwaggerDocument swaggerDoc, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, IApiExplorer apiExplorer);

  ```


  This gives full control to modify the final SwaggerDocument. You can gain additional context from the provided SwaggerDocument (e.g. version) and IApiExplorer. You should have a good understanding of the [Swagger 2.0 spec.](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) before using this option.


  ### Wrapping the SwaggerGenerator with Additional Behavior ###


  The default implementation of ISwaggerProvider, the interface used to obtain Swagger metadata for a given API, is the SwaggerGenerator. If neccessary, you can inject your own implementation or wrap the existing one with additional behavior. For example, you could use this option to inject a "Caching Proxy" that attempts to retrieve the SwaggerDocument from a cache before delegating to the built-in generator:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
        .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
            {
          c.CustomProvider((defaultProvider) => new CachingSwaggerProvider(defaultProvider));
            });
  ```


  ### Including XML Comments ###


  If you annotate Controllers and API Types with [Xml Comments](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b2s063f7(v=vs.110).aspx), you can incorporate those comments into the generated docs and UI. The Xml tags are mapped to Swagger properties as follows:


  * **Action summary** -> Operation.summary

  * **Action remarks** -> Operation.description

  * **Parameter summary** -> Parameter.description

  * **Type summary** -> Schema.descripton

  * **Property summary** -> Schema.description (i.e. on a property Schema)


  You can enable this by providing the path to one or more XML comments files:

  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API");
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForControllers());
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForModels());
          });
  ```


  NOTE: You will need to enable output of the XML documentation file. This is enabled by going to project properties -> Build -> Output. The "XML documentation file" needs to be checked and a path assigned, such as "bin\Debug\MyProj.XML". You will also want to verify this across each build configuration. Here's an example of reading the file, but it may need to be modified according to your specific project settings:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c =>
          {
              var baseDirectory = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory;
              var commentsFileName = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name + ".XML";
              var commentsFile = Path.Combine(baseDirectory, commentsFileName);

              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API");
              c.IncludeXmlComments(commentsFile);
              c.IncludeXmlComments(GetXmlCommentsPathForModels());
          });
  ```

  #### Response Codes ####


  Swashbuckle will automatically create a "success" response for each operation based on the action's return type. If it's a void, the status code will be 204 (No content), otherwise 200 (Ok). This mirrors WebApi's default behavior. If you need to change this and/or list additional response codes, you can use the non-standard "response" tag:


  ```csharp

  /// <response code="201">Account created</response>

  /// <response code="400">Username already in use</response>

  public int Create(Account account)

  ```

  ### Working Around Swagger 2.0 Constraints ###


  In contrast to Web API, Swagger 2.0 does not include the query string component when mapping a URL to an action. As a result, Swashbuckle will raise an exception if it encounters multiple actions with the same path (sans query string) and HTTP method. You can workaround this by providing a custom strategy to pick a winner or merge the descriptions for the purposes of the Swagger docs 


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger((c) =>
          {
              c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"));
              c.ResolveConflictingActions(apiDescriptions => apiDescriptions.First());
          });
  ```

  See the following discussion for more details:


  <https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/142>


  ## Customizing the swagger-ui ##


  The swagger-ui is a JavaScript application hosted in a single HTML page (index.html), and it exposes several customization settings. Swashbuckle ships with an embedded version and includes corresponding configuration methods for each of the UI settings. If you require further customization, you can also inject your own version of "index.html". Read on to learn more.


  ### Customizations via the configuration API ###


  If you're happy with the basic look and feel but want to make some minor tweaks, the following options may be sufficient:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
          {
              c.InjectStylesheet(containingAssembly, "Swashbuckle.Dummy.SwaggerExtensions.testStyles1.css");
              c.InjectJavaScript(containingAssembly, "Swashbuckle.Dummy.SwaggerExtensions.testScript1.js");
              c.SetValidatorUrl("http://localhost/validator");
              c.DisableValidator();
              c.DocExpansion(DocExpansion.List);
              c.SupportedSubmitMethods("GET", "HEAD")
          });
  ```


  #### InjectStylesheet ####


  Use this to enrich the UI with one or more additional CSS stylesheets. The file(s) must be included in your project as an "Embedded Resource", and then the resource's "Logical Name" is passed to the method as shown above. See [Injecting Custom Content](#injecting-custom-content) for step by step instructions.


  #### InjectJavaScript ####


  Use this to invoke one or more custom JavaScripts after the swagger-ui has loaded. The file(s) must be included in your project as an "Embedded Resource", and then the resource's "Logical Name" is passed to the method as shown above. See [Injecting Custom Content](#injecting-custom-content) for step by step instructions.


  #### SetValidatorUrl/DisableValidator ####


  By default, swagger-ui will validate specs against swagger.io's online validator and display the result in a badge at the bottom of the page. Use these options to set a different validator URL or to disable the feature entirely.


  #### DocExpansion ####


  Use this option to control how the Operation listing is displayed. It can be set to "None" (default), "List" (shows operations for each resource), or "Full" (fully expanded: shows operations and their details).


  #### SupportedSubmitMethods ####


  Specify which HTTP operations will have the 'Try it out!' option. An empty parameter list disables it for all operations.


  ### Provide your own "index" file ###


  As an alternative, you can inject your own version of "index.html" and customize the markup and swagger-ui directly. Use the __CustomAsset__ option to instruct Swashbuckle to return your version instead of the default when a request is made for "index". As with all custom content, the file must be included in your project as an "Embedded Resource", and then the resource's "Logical Name" is passed to the method as shown below. See [Injecting Custom Content](#injecting-custom-content) for step by step instructions.


  For compatibility, you should base your custom "index.html" off [this version](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/blob/v5.5.3/Swashbuckle.Core/SwaggerUi/CustomAssets/index.html)


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
       .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "A title for your API"))
       .EnableSwaggerUi(c =>
           {
               c.CustomAsset("index", yourAssembly, "YourWebApiProject.SwaggerExtensions.index.html");
           });
  ```


  ### Injecting Custom Content ###


  The __InjectStylesheet__, __InjectJavaScript__ and __CustomAsset__ options all share the same mechanism for providing custom content. In each case, the file must be included in your project as an "Embedded Resource". The steps to do this are described below:


  1. Add a new file to your Web API project.

  2. In Solution Explorer, right click the file and open its properties window. Change the "Build Action" to "Embedded Resource".


  This will embed the file in your assembly and register it with a "Logical Name". This can then be passed to the relevant configuration method. It's based on the Project's default namespace, file location and file extension. For example, given a default namespace of "YourWebApiProject" and a file located at "/SwaggerExtensions/index.html", then the resource will be assigned the name - "YourWebApiProject.SwaggerExtensions.index.html". If you use "Swagger" as the root folder name for your custom assets, this will collide with the default route templates and the page will not be loaded correctly.


  ## Transitioning to Swashbuckle 5.0 ##


  This version of Swashbuckle makes the transition to Swagger 2.0. The 2.0 specification is significantly different to its predecessor (1.2) and forces several breaking changes to Swashbuckle's configuration API. If you're using Swashbuckle without any customizations, i.e. App_Start/SwaggerConfig.cs has never been modified, then you can overwrite it with the new version. The defaults are the same and so the swagger-ui should behave as before.


  \* If you have consumers of the raw Swagger document, you should ensure they can accept Swagger 2.0 before making the upgrade.


  If you're using the existing configuration API to customize the final Swagger document and/or swagger-ui, you will need to port the code manually. The static __Customize__ methods on SwaggerSpecConfig and SwaggerUiConfig have been replaced with extension methods on HttpConfiguration - __EnableSwagger__ and __EnableSwaggerUi__. All options from version 4.0 are made available through these methods, albeit with slightly different naming and syntax. Refer to the tables below for a summary of changes:



  | 4.0 | 5.0 Equivalent | Additional Notes |

  | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |

  | ResolveBasePathUsing | RootUrl | |

  | ResolveTargetVersionUsing | N/A | version is now implicit in the docs URL e.g. "swagger/docs/{apiVersion}" |

  | ApiVersion | SingleApiVersion| now supports additional metadata for the version | 

  | SupportMultipleApiVersions | MultipleApiVersions | now supports additional metadata for each version |

  | Authorization | BasicAuth/ApiKey/OAuth2 | | 

  | GroupDeclarationsBy | GroupActionsBy | |

  | SortDeclarationsBy | OrderActionGroupsBy | |

  | MapType | MapType | now accepts Func&lt;Schema&gt; instead of Func&lt;DataType&gt; |

  | ModelFilter | SchemaFilter | IModelFilter is now ISchemaFilter, DataTypeRegistry is now SchemaRegistry |

  | OperationFilter | OperationFilter | DataTypeRegistry is now SchemaRegistry |

  | PolymorphicType | N/A | not currently supported |

  | SupportHeaderParams | N/A | header params are implicitly supported |

  | SupportedSubmitMethods | N/A | all HTTP verbs are implicitly supported |

  | CustomRoute | CustomAsset | &nbsp; |

  ### Swagger-ui showing "Can't read swagger JSON from ..."


  If you see this message, it means the swagger-ui received an unexpected response when requesting the Swagger document. You can troubleshoot further by navigating directly to the discovery URL included in the error message. This should provide more details.


  If the discovery URL returns a 404 Not Found response, it may be due to a full-stop in the version name (e.g. "1.0"). This will cause IIS to treat it as a static file (i.e. with an extension) and bypass the URL Routing Module and therefore, Web API. 


  To workaround, you can update the version name specified in SwaggerConfig.cs. For example, to "v1", "1-0" etc. Alternatively, you can change the route template being used for the swagger docs (as shown [here](#custom-routes)) so that the version parameter is not at the end of the route.


  ### Page not found when accessing the UI ###


  Swashbuckle serves an embedded version of the swagger-ui through the Web API pipeline. But, most of the URLs contain extensions (.html, .js, .css) and many IIS environments are configured to bypass the managed pipeline for paths containing extensions.


  In previous versions of Swashbuckle, this was resolved by adding the following setting to your Web.config:


  ```xml

  <system.webServer>
    <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" />
  </system.webServer>

  ```


  This is no longer neccessary in Swashbuckle 5.0 because it serves the swagger-ui through extensionless URL's.


  However, if you're using the SingleApiVersion, MultipleApiVersions or CustomAsset configuration settings you could still get this error. Check to ensure you're not specifying a value that causes a URL with an extension to be referenced in the UI. For example a full-stop in a version number ...


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration
      .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("1.0", "A title for your API"))
      .EnableSwaggerUi();
  ```

  will result in a discovery URL like this "/swagger/docs/1.0" where the full-stop is treated as a file extension.


  ### Swagger-ui broken by Visual Studio 2013 ###


  VS 2013 ships with a new feature - Browser Link - that improves the web development workflow by setting up a channel between the IDE and pages being previewed in a local browser. It does this by dynamically injecting JavaScript into your files.


  Although this JavaScript SHOULD have no affect on your production code, it appears to be breaking the swagger-ui.


  I hope to find a permanent fix, but in the meantime, you'll need to workaround this issue by disabling the feature in your web.config:


  ```xml

  <appSettings>
      <add key="vs:EnableBrowserLink" value="false"/>
  </appSettings>

  ```

  ### OWIN Hosted in IIS - Incorrect VirtualPathRoot Handling


  When you host Web API 2 on top of OWIN/SystemWeb, Swashbuckle cannot correctly resolve VirtualPathRoot by default.


  You must either explicitly set VirtualPathRoot in your HttpConfiguration at startup, or perform customization like this to fix automatic discovery:


  ```csharp

  httpConfiguration.EnableSwagger(c => 

  {
      c.RootUrl(req =>
          req.RequestUri.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority) +
          req.GetRequestContext().VirtualPathRoot.TrimEnd('/'));
  }

  ```


  ### How to add vendor extensions


  Swagger 2.0 allows additional meta-data (aka vendor extensions) to be added at various points in the Swagger document. Swashbuckle supports this by including a "vendorExtensions" dictionary with each of the extensible Swagger types. Meta-data can be added to these dictionaries from custom Schema, Operation or Document filters. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ApplySchemaVendorExtensions : ISchemaFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Schema schema, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, Type type)
      {
          schema.vendorExtensions.Add("x-foo", "bar");
      }
  }

  ```


  As per the specification, all extension properties should be prefixed by "x-"


  ### FromUri Query string DataMember names are incorrect


  When using `FromUri` Model Binding, it is possible to override the querystring parameter name's using `DataMember`s. In this case you can add a custom operation filter to override the name. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ComplexTypeOperationFilter : IOperationFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription apiDescription)
      {
          if (operation.parameters == null)
              return;

          var parameters = apiDescription.ActionDescriptor.GetParameters();
          foreach (var parameter in parameters)
          {
              foreach (var property in parameter.ParameterType.GetProperties())
              {
                  var param = operation.parameters.FirstOrDefault(o => o.name.ToLowerInvariant().Contains(property.Name.ToLowerInvariant()));

                  if (param == null) continue;

                  var name = GetNameFromAttribute(property);

                  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
                  {
                      operation.parameters.Remove(param);
                  }
                  param.name = GetNameFromAttribute(property);
              }
          }
      }
      
      private static string GetNameFromAttribute(PropertyInfo property)
      {
          var customAttributes = property.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(DataMemberAttribute), true);
          if (customAttributes.Length > 0)
          {
              var attribute = customAttributes[0] as DataMemberAttribute;
              if (attribute != null) return attribute.Name;
          }
          return string.Empty;
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Remove Duplicate Path Parameters


  When using `FromUri` Model Binding, duplicate items can appear as items can be passed as URI parameters, or querystrings. In this case you can add a custom operation filter to remove the duplicates. For example:


  ```csharp

  public class ComplexTypeOperationFilter : IOperationFilter

  {
      public void Apply(Operation operation, SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry, ApiDescription apiDescription)
      {
         if (operation.parameters == null)
             return;
         var complexParameters = operation.parameters.Where(x => x.@in == "query" && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x.name)).ToArray();

         foreach (var parameter in complexParameters)
         {
             if (!parameter.name.Contains('.')) continue;
             var name = parameter.name.Split('.')[1];

             var opParams = operation.parameters.Where(x => x.name == name);
             var parameters = opParams as Parameter[] ?? opParams.ToArray();

             if (parameters.Length > 0)
             {
                 operation.parameters.Remove(parameter);
             }
         }
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Deploying behind Load Balancer / Reverse Proxies


  Swashbuckle attempts to populate the [Swagger "host"](http://swagger.io/specification/#swaggerObject) property from HTTP headers that are sent with the request for Swagger JSON. This may cause issues in load balancer / reverse proxy environments, particularly if non-standard headers are used to pass on the outer most host name. You can workaround this by providing your own function for determining your API's root URL based on vendor-specific headers. Checkout [issue 705](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/issues/705) for some potential implementations.


  ### 500 : {"Message":"An error has occurred."}


  If, on loading the Swagger UI page, you get an error: `500 : {"Message":"An error has occurred."} http://<url>/swagger/docs/v1` ensure that the XML documentation output settings have been set in the project file in the solution, for both Debug and Release configurations.

  A php library to manipulate [swagger](http://swagger.io)/[Open API](https://openapis.org) specifications.


  ## Installation


  ```

  composer require gossi/swagger

  ```


  ## Usage


  Read an `api.json` file:


  ```php

  $swagger = Swagger::fromFile('api.json');


  // or


  $swagger = new Swagger($array);

  ```


  ### Collections


  There are two major collections: `Paths` and `Definitions`. The API is similar for both:


  ```php

  $paths = $swagger->getPaths();

  $p = new Path('/user');


  // adding

  $paths->add($p);


  // retrieving

  if ($paths->has('/user') || $paths->contains($p)) {
  	$path = $paths->get('/user');
  }


  // removing

  $paths->remove('/user');


  // iterating

  foreach ($paths as $path) {
  	// do sth with $path
  }

  ```


  Other collections are: `Headers`, `Parameters`, `Responses` and `SecurityDefinitions`.


  ### Models


  There are a lot of models, e.g. the mentioned `Path` above. The API is well written, so it works with the auto-completion of your IDE. It is straight forward and uses the same naming scheme as the OpenAPI specification.



  ## Contributing


  Feel free to fork and submit a pull request (don't forget the tests) and I am happy to merge.

  # New! AutoRest Version 3.0 

  AutoRest 3.0 introduces a large number of internal changes to support new scenarios. 


  ## Features


  ### OpenAPI3 support! 

  AutoRest 3.0 finally supports OpenAPI3 files as an input format, with the following caveats:

  - existing AutoRest v2 generators may not support all features from OpenAPI3. (see next section)

  - `anyOf`, `oneOf` are not currently supported 

  - other OpenAPI3 specific features may not be entirely supported.


  ### Generators


  A new set of language generator plugins are being written that adopt the lighter-weight patterns for Azure Core libraries.<br>

  Existing V2 generators will default to processing with the AutoRest 2 pipeline. <br>

  If you want to force it to use the v3 (to get support for OpenAPI3 ) add `--v3` to the command line:

  > `autorest --v3 --csharp ...`


  | Generator | Command | Notes |

  |----|---|---|

  |PowerShell| `autorest --powershell ...` |Fully V3 Supported - use to generate powershell modules |   

  |CSharp|`autorest --csharp ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3` switch (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress | 

  |Python|`autorest --python ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3` switch (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress| 

  |Java|`autorest --java ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3` switch (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress | 

  |TypeScript|`autorest --typescript ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3` switch (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress | 

  |Go|`autorest --go ...` |v2 generator, may use OpenAPI3 with `--v3` switch (may be some differences) - v3 generator in progress | 

  |Ruby|`autorest --ruby ...` |v2 generator - does not support v3 feature, no OpenAPI3 support | 


  #### New V3 Pipeline


  In AutoRest v3, the pipeline has been drastically rebuilt, which allows support for:

  - OpenAPI3 inputs

  - Supporting merging multiple API versions 

  - Model Deduplication and Subset reduction across multiple API versions

  - Azure Profile support (v3 generator required)


  Some related information:

  - [Validation Rules & Linting](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/master/docs/readme.md) - about the validation rules in AutoRest

  - [Client Runtimes](./docs/developer/architecture/Autorest-and-Clientruntimes.md) - information about the client runtimes required for using code generated by AutoRest

  <!-- - [Developer Guide](./docs/developer/guide/) - Notes on developing with AutoRest -->


  ### Supported Platforms


  While AutoRest itself runs on NodeJS, some generators use the .NET Core 2.0 runtime, which is the most limiting factor.

  See [dotnet/core/release-notes/2.0/2.0-supported-os.md](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.0/2.0-supported-os.md) for a list of supported platforms.

  # swagmock

  Mock data generator for swagger api


  *Note: Swagmock version `1.0.0` onwards requires `Node.js v6+` (`"engines": {"node": ">=6.x"}`). Please use `v0.0.x` (say `0.0.5`), if you want to run this module on any previous node.js versions.*


  ## Install


  ```

  npm install swagmock

  ```


  ## Usage


  ```javascript
      let Swagmock = require('swagmock');
      let Mockgen = Swagmock(api, options);
      // api Can be one of the following.
      // 1) A relative or absolute path to the Swagger api document.
      // 2) A swagger api Object.
      // 3) A promise (or a `thenable`) that resolves to the swagger api Object.
      // Set the `validated` : `true`  in `options`, if the api Object is already validated
      // and dereferenced ($ref are resolved ).
  ```


  Promise response:


  ```javascript
      let responseMock = Mockgen.responses({}); //returns a promise that resolves to response mock
      responseMock.then(mock => {
          //Use mock here
      }).catch(error => {
          Assert.ifError(error);
      });
  ```


  Callback style:


  ```javascript

      Mockgen.responses({ path: '/somepath'}, (error, mock) => {
          Assert.ifError(error);
          //Use mock here
      });
  ```


  Check the [API](README.md#api) for more details.


  ## Example


  Initialize the mock generator


  ```javascript
      const apiPath = 'http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json';
      let Assert = require('assert');
      let Swagmock = require('swagmock');
      let Mockgen = Swagmock(apiPath);
  ```


  Response mock generation:


  ```javascript
      mockgen.responses({
          path: '/pet/findByStatus',
          operation: 'get',
          response: 200
      }).then(mock => {
          console.log(mock); // This would print:
          // {
          //     "responses": [{
          //         "id": 2530624032210944,
          //         "category": {
          //             "id": 8200505595527168,
          //             "name": "r($vA&"
          //         },
          //         "name": "doggie",
          //         "photoUrls": ["p0x1", "6O)3*kO"],
          //         "tags": [{
          //             "id": 4590764340281344,
          //             "name": "WCTA6f!"
          //         }, {
          //             "id": -4614156653166592,
          //             "name": "e"
          //         }],
          //         "status": "pending"
          //     }]
          // }
      }).catch(error => {
          Assert.ifError(error);
      });
  ```


  Parameters mock generation:


  ```javascript

      mockgen.parameters({
          path: '/pet/findByStatus',
          operation: 'get'
      }).then(mock => {
          console.log(mock);//This would print:
          // {
          //     "parameters": {
          //         "query": [{
          //             "name": "status",
          //             "value": [ 'available', 'pending' ],
          //             "separator": "multi"
          //         }]
          //     }
          // }
      }).catch(error => {
          Assert.ifError(error);
      })

  ```


  Check [Examples](docs/EXAMPLES.md) for more details on mock generators.


  ## API


  `Swagmock(api, [options])`


  * `api` - (*Object*) or (*String*) or (*Promise*) - (required) - api can be one of the following.
      - A relative or absolute path to the Swagger api document.
      - A URL of the Swagger api document.
      - The swagger api Object
      - A promise (or a `thenable`) that resolves to the swagger api Object

  * `options` - (*Object*) - (optional) - Additional options to create the mock generator.
      - `validated` -  Set this property to `true` if the api is already validated against swagger schema and already dereferenced all the `$ref`. This is really useful to generate mocks for parsed api specs. Default value for this is `false` and the api will be validated using [swagger-parser validate](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-parser/blob/master/docs/swagger-parser.md#validateapi-options-callback).

  ## responses


  `mockgen.responses(options, [callback])`


  This generates the mock response objects based on the `options`


  * `options` - (*Object*) - (required) - Options to control the mock generation.


  * `callback` -  (*Function*) - (optional) - `function (error, mock)`. If a callback is not provided a `Promise` will be returned.


  ### options


  * `path` - (*String*) - (optional) - The path for which the response mock need to be generated. For example `/pet/findByStatus`, `/pet` etc. If a `path` is not specified, mock response will be generated for all the paths defined by the swagger api.


  * `operation` - (*String*) - (optional) - The operation for which the response mock need to be generated. For example `get`, `post` etc. If `operation` is not specified, mock response will be generated for all the operations defined by the swagger api.


  * `response` - (*String*) - (optional) - The response for which the response mock need to be generated. For example `200`, `400`, `default` etc. If `response` is not specified, mock response will be generated for all the responses defined by the swagger api.


  * `useExamples` - (*Boolean*)- (optional) - Should the generated mock make use of example values defined in your swagger.json. Note: invalid example values will create invalid mockdata!


  ## parameters


  `mockgen.parameters(options, [callback])`


  This generates the mock parameters objects based on the `options`


  * `options` - (*Object*) - (required) - Options to control the mock generation.


  * `callback` -  (*Function*) - (optional) - `function (error, mock)`. If a callback is not provided a `Promise` will be returned.


  ### options


  * `path` - (*String*) - (optional) - The path for which the parameters mock need to be generated. For example `/pet/findByStatus`, `/pet` etc. If a `path` is not specified, mock parameters will be generated for all the paths defined by the swagger api.


  * `operation` - (*String*) - (optional) - The operation for which the parameters mock need to be generated. For example `get`, `post` etc. If `operation` is not specified, mock parameters will be generated for all the operations defined by the swagger api.



  ## requests


  `mockgen.requests(options, [callback])`


  This generates the mock request object based on the `options`. `requests` API resolves the `parameters` mock data to generate the `request` mock object useful for unit tests.


  * `options` - (*Object*) - (required) - Options to control the mock generation.


  * `callback` -  (*Function*) - (optional) - `function (error, mock)`. If a callback is not provided a `Promise` will be returned.


  ### options


  * `path` - (*String*) - (optional) - The path for which the parameters mock need to be generated. For example `/pet/findByStatus`, `/pet` etc. If a `path` is not specified, mock parameters will be generated for all the paths defined by the swagger api.


  * `operation` - (*String*) - (optional) - The operation for which the parameters mock need to be generated. For example `get`, `post` etc. If `operation` is not specified, mock parameters will be generated for all the operations defined by the swagger api.


  ### data


  `request` Object will have following possible properties `query`, `header`, `pathname`, `path`, `formData` or `body` based on the `parameters` defined for the path and operation.


  Mock request [Path templates](http://swagger.io/specification/#pathTemplating) are resolved using path parameters.


  ```javascript
      mockgen.requests({
          path: '/pet/findByStatus',
          operation: 'get'
      }, function (error, mock) {
          assert.ifError(error);

          console.log(mock);
          //This would print:
          // {
          //     "request": {
          //         "query": "status=available&status=pending"
          //     }
          // }
      });
  ```

  ======


  BlueOak Server is a NodeJS framework for building RESTful APIs.


  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server)

  [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/blueoak-server.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blueoak-server)


  BlueOak Server is _swagger-matic_, that is, it maximizes the value of your Swagger API (now OpenAPI, but really this supports only V2) by using it to drive runtime behavior.  

  BlueOak Server loads your Swagger API, connects the paths it defines to your implementation code, exposes that API to the network, and validates that every request is well-formed per that API.


  Check out the documentation on our wiki: <https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki>


  ### Overview


  BlueOak Server combines some of the best Node libraries into a single tool for building RESTful APIs.  It uses Express under the covers, but adds many additional features:


  - Swagger integration

  - Easy configuration

  - Clustering

  - Logging

  - Dependency injection


  Projects use the following directory structure.


  ```

  ├── [your_project_name]/

  │   ├── index.js <-- optional Main script

  │   ├── package.json

  |   ├── config/

  |   |     └── default.json

  │   ├── handlers/

  │   ├── services/

  │   ├── middleware/

  │   ├── swagger/

  ```


  #### Handlers

  [Handlers](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Handlers) contain Express route-handling functions.  They can either be directly wired to routes on the Express _app_, or defined using Swagger.


  To use the _app_ directly, simply create a js file in the handlers directory that exports an `init` function.

  The `init` function is called during server startup and injected with the the _app_ automatically.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(app) {
    app.get('/', function(req, res) {
      res.json({});
    });
  }


  ```


  #### Services

  [Services](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Services) do most of the heavy lifting.  Like handlers, services contain init functions that are called during server startup.  However, services can export other functions, and those functions can be invoked from handlers.


  Here's an example of a fizzbuzz service (services/fizzbuzz.js).  You'll notice it has an init method with two parameters, _logger_ and _callback_.  The _logger_ is a [built-in service](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Logging-Service) for logging.  The _callback_ is an optional parameter used for cases where services need to perform asynchronous operations during startup.  The service also exports a _getResult_ function.  Any service or handler with a dependency on _fizzbuzz_ can invoke `fizzbuzz.getResult`.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(logger, callback) {
    logger.info("Starting FizzBuzz service");
    callback();
  }


  exports.getResult = function(num) {
      if (num % 15 === 0) {
          return "FizzBuzz";
      } else if (num % 3 === 0) {
          return "Fizz";
      } else if (num % 5 === 0) {
          return "Buzz";
      } else {
          return num;
      }
  };
    
  ```


  We want to use that service from our handler, so we include `fizzbuzz` as a parameter of the `init` function.

  The server will ensure that the fizzbuzz service is initialized during server startup and passed to the handler.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(app, fizzbuzz) {

    app.get('/fizzbuzz/:num', function(req, res) {
      var num = req.params.num;
      res.json({
          result: fizzbuzz.getResult(num)
       });
    });

    
  }

  ```

  #### Third-party Services

  Services can be published as npm modules and pulled into projects through the `npm install` command.


  For example, the bos-couchdb service adds the ability to connect to a CouchDB database.

  It can be installed to a blueoak-server project using


  ```bash

  $ npm install bos-couchdb --save

  ```


  Once installed, it can be used in any service or handler through the dependency-injected `bosCouchdb` parameter.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(config, logger, bosCouchdb) {
    var myDb = bosCouchdb.get('mydb');
  }


  ```


  * [bos-couchdb](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/bos-couchdb) - service for connecting to CouchDB databases


  #### Config

  [Configuration](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Services#config) is stored in json files in the _config_ directory.  Values can be accessed through the `config` service in handers and services.  Configuration also supports layering on environment-specific config as well as encrypted values.


  ```js

  exports.init = function(config) {
    var myServiceConfig = config.get('myService');
  }

  ```


  #### Middleware

  [Middleware](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Middleware) are similar to services but used to wire up Express middleware.  The _express_ section of the config determines which middleware is loaded and in which order.


  ```json

  {
    "express": {
      "middleware": ["csrf", "cors", "session", "body-parser"]
    }
  }

  ```


  #### Swagger (OpenAPI)


  [Swagger](https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server/wiki/Handlers#swagger) files in the _swagger_ directory are read during server startup and automatically wired up to handlers. Swagger files can be in either json or yaml formats.


  We've really focused on making API development with Swagger and BlueOak Server to be excellent.


  At a high-level, BlueOak Server's Swagger support provides the following:

  * Automatic app routing from the API method to the function as defined in the Swagger

  * Request parameter validation, including the body model, based on your method definion

  * Reponse model validation based on your method definitions during development

  * JSON `$ref`s to external Swagger documents on the file system

  * Multiple top-level Swagger API definitions supporting delivery of multiple API base paths

  * Publishing of the fully compiled Swagger spec for input to by tools such as [`Swagger-UI`](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) and [`swagger-commander`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-commander)

  $ blueoak-server

  ```


  If installed at a package level, call _blueoak-server_ in the `npm start` script.

  e.g.:

  ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "blueoak-server"
    }
  ```


  Alternatively, it can be launched programmatically from your own js script.



  ```js

  var server = require('blueoak-server');


  server.init(function(err) {
      if (err) {
          console.warn(err);
      } else {
          console.log('started');
      }
  });

  ```


  The programmatic approach works well during development with tools like nodemon,

  which monitor for file changes and automatically restart the server.

  # flask-swagger

  A Swagger 2.0 spec extractor for Flask


  You can now specify base path for yml files:

  ```python

  app = Flask(__name__)


  @app.route("/spec")

  def spec():
      base_path = os.path.join(app.root_path, 'docs')
      return jsonify(swagger(app), from_file_keyword="swagger_from_file", base_path=base_path)
  ```

  and use relative paths:

  ```python

  @app.route('/test', methods=['POST'])

  def login():
      """
      swagger_from_file: test.yml
      """
  ```


  Install:


  ```shell

  pip install flask-swagger

  ```

  Flask-swagger provides a method (swagger) that inspects the Flask app for endpoints that contain YAML docstrings with Swagger 2.0 [Operation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) objects.


  ```python

  class UserAPI(MethodView):

      def post(self):
          """
          Create a new user
          ---

                  groups:

                    description: list of groups
                    items:

          responses:
            201:

          return {}
  ```

  Flask-swagger supports docstrings in methods of MethodView classes (à la [Flask-RESTful](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful)) and regular Flask view functions.


  Following YAML conventions, flask-swagger searches for `---`, everything preceding is provided as `summary` (first line) and `description` (following lines) for the endpoint while everything after is parsed as a swagger [Operation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) object.


  In order to support inline definition of [Schema ](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject) objects in [Parameter](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterObject)  and [Response](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#responsesObject) objects, flask-swagger veers a little off from the standard. We require an `id` field for the inline Schema which is then used to correctly place the [Schema](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject) object in the [Definitions](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#definitionsObject) object.



  [Schema ](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject) objects can be defined in a definitions section within the docstrings (see group object above) or within responses or parameters (see user object above). We also support schema objects nested within the properties of other [Schema ](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject) objects. An example is shown above with the address property of User.


  If you don't like to put YAML on docstrings you can put the same content in an external file.


  #### file.yml

  ```yaml

  Create a new user

  ---

  tags:
    - users
  definitions:
    - schema:
        id: Group
        properties:
          name:
           type: string
           description: the group's name
  parameters:
    - in: body
      name: body
      schema:
        id: User
        required:
          - email
          - name
        properties:
          email:
            type: string
            description: email for user
          name:
            type: string
            description: name for user
          address:
            description: address for user
            schema:
              id: Address
              properties:
                street:
                  type: string
                state:
                  type: string
                country:
                  type: string
                postalcode:
                  type: string
          groups:
            type: array
            description: list of groups
            items:
              $ref: "#/definitions/Group"
  responses:
    201:
      description: User created
  ```


  and point to it in your docstring.


  ```python

  class UserAPI(MethodView):

      def post(self):
          """
          Create a new user

          blah blah

          swagger_from_file: path/to/file.yml

          blah blah
          """
          return {}
  ```


  Note that you can replace `swagger_from_file` by another keyword. Supply your chosen keyword as an argument to swagger. 



  To expose your Swagger specification to the world you provide a Flask route that does something along these lines


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flask_swagger import swagger


  app = Flask(__name__)


  @app.route("/spec")

  def spec():
      return jsonify(swagger(app))
  ```


  Note that the Swagger specification returned by `swagger(app)` is as minimal as it can be. It's your job to override and add to the specification as you see fit.


  ```python

  @app.route("/spec")

  def spec():
      swag = swagger(app)
      swag['info']['version'] = "1.0"
      swag['info']['title'] = "My API"
      return jsonify(swag)
  ```



  [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)


  Swagger-UI is the reason we embarked on this mission to begin with, flask-swagger does not however include Swagger-UI. Simply follow the awesome documentation over at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui and point your [swaggerUi.url](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui#swaggerui) to your new flask-swagger endpoint and enjoy.


  ## flaskswagger Command

  This package now comes with a very simple command line interface: flaskswagger. This command can be used to build and update swagger specs for your flask apps from the command line or at build time.


  ```shell

  flaskswagger -h

  ```


  ```

  usage: flaskswagger [-h] [--template TEMPLATE] [--out-dir OUT_DIR]
                      [--definitions DEFINITIONS] [--host HOST]
                      [--base-path BASE_PATH] [--version VERSION]
                      app

  positional arguments:
    app                   the flask app to swaggerify

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --template TEMPLATE   template spec to start with, before any other options
                          or processing
    --out-dir OUT_DIR     the directory to output to
    --definitions DEFINITIONS
                          json definitions file
    --host HOST
    --base-path BASE_PATH
    --version VERSION     Specify a spec version

  ```


  For example, this can be used to build a swagger spec which can be served from your static directory. In the example below, we use the manually created swagger.json.manual as a template, and output to the `static/` directory.


  ```shell

  flaskswagger server:app --template static/swagger.json.manual --out-dir static/

  ```

  Also, you can ask flaskswagger to add host and basePath to your swagger spec:  


  ```shell

  flaskswagger server:app --host localhost:5000 --base-path /v1

  ```

mobilcom-debitel/pokemock: "# Pokemock\r

  \r

  A mock server generated from one or more arbitrary Swagger files.\r

  Supports seeding, timeouts, response picking,\r

  entity memory, semantic action inference, etc.\r

  \r

  \r

  ## Usage\r

  \r

  ```\r

  Syntax:\r

  \  pokemock <swagger-urls-or-files> ... [-h] [-v] [-w] [-p <port>]\r

  \      --memory      Enable memory module (experimental)\r

  ```\r

  \r

  \r

  ## Server\r

  \r

  The mock server listens to the specified port and\r

  mocks endpoints defined in the provided Swagger document.\r

  Additionally, it publishes a Swagger UI under `/ui`,\r

  the Swagger API under `/api-docs` and a `/kill` endpoint for shutdown.\r

  \r

  \r

  ## Request Headers\r

  \r

  Using optional headers, clients can control the server's behavior:\r

  \r

  - __X-Mock-Status__\r

  \  - Specifies the response status code\r

  \  - The correct response is inferred from the API if possible\r

  \  - Defaults to the first response code specified in the API\r

  - __X-Mock-Seed__\r

  \  - Specifies a seed for data generation\r

  \  - If omitted, a random seed is generated\r

  \  - The current seed is always returned in a X-Mock-Seed response header\r

  \  - Specifies the minimum response time (milliseconds)\r

  - __X-Mock-Size__\r

  \  - Specifies array size(s) in the response\r

  \  - Must be a valid JSON object of\r

  \    `<definitionName|attributeName>: <size>` pairs\r

  \  - If omitted, array sizes are randomly between 1 and 5\r

  - __X-Mock-Depth__\r

  \  - Specifies the maximum JSON data depth\r

  \  - Defaults to 5\r

  - __X-Mock-Override__\r

  \  - Specifies response data via [JSON
  Path](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath)\r

  \  - Must be a valid JSON object of `<jsonPath>: <data>` pairs\r

  \  - `<data>` is arbitrary JSON\r

  - __X-Mock-Replay__\r

  \  - Specifies the number of times the current X-Mock-* headers should be

  \  - The next N requests to the requested URL will replay the current
  X-Mock-* headers\r

  - __X-Mock-Replay-Pattern__\r

  \  - Specifies a regular expression to match for X-Mock-Replay\r

  \  - If omitted, the exact path is used for replaying\r

  \r

  \r

  ## Memory (experimental)\r

  \r

  Use the `--memory` switch to enable the memory module.\r

  When enabled, entities containing an ID are remembered by the server.\r

  If the entity is requested again, the remembered data is returned.\r

  This also applies to sub-entities across endpoints.\r

  \r

  Additionally, the server tries to infer semantic actions from requests,\r

  such as:\r

  \r

  - Get by id\r

  - Delete by id\r

  - Update by id\r

  - Create new entity\r

  \r

  These actions are applied to known entities in memory.\r

  For example, requesting a deleted entity will result in a 404 response.\r

  \r

  \r

  ## Customization\r

  \r

  Pokemock provides a set of [Express](http://expressjs.com/de/) middlewares\r

  which you can use independently.\r

  The default app defined in `createDefaultApp.js` is an opinionated stack
  of\r

  middlewares which you're encouraged to hack on.\r

  By re-arranging and adding middlewares (especially generators)\r

  you can tailor Pokemock to fit your APIs.\r\n"

  # SBT Swagger Code Generator


  ## Overview


  Like the official [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) this project aims to generate Scala source code from [Swagger 2.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) compliant API descriptions.

  Moreover, you can do it directly within an `sbt` project.


  ## Compatibility


  This code generator is designed specifically for Swagger Spec Version 2.0. Moreover, it relies on [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) 2.7 for Json marshalling/unmarshalling, server- and client-side code.


  ## Install


  Current release is [`0.0.12`](https://github.com/unicredit/sbt-swagger-codegen/tree/0.0.12)


  If you want to try the latest version on `master`, first clone this project and `publishLocal` it.


  Enable it inside your `project\plugins.sbt` like this:


  `addSbtPlugin("eu.unicredit" % "sbt-swagger-codegen" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")`


  Enable it in your `build.sbt` like this:


  `enablePlugins(SwaggerCodegenPlugin)`


  ## Quick start


  For a *super fast* hands-on tutorial refer to the related examples and check out [sbt-swagger-codegen-examples](https://github.com/unicredit/sbt-swagger-codegen-examples).


  ## How it works


  By default, the plugin will assume that you have put your `yaml` Swagger specification files under `src/main/swagger`.


  If so, then you can just run `swaggerModelCodeGen` task and it will generate your *models* as case classes and [Play Framework](www.playframework.com) [Formats](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJsonCombinators#Format) for them (for json serialization).


  ## Tasks


  All available tasks from the plugin


  - `swaggerModelCodeGen`  -> generated code for model classes

  - `swaggerServerCodeGen` -> generates Play Framework code

  - `swaggerClientCodeGen` -> generates client code using `play-ws`

  - `swaggerClean` -> cleans up already generated code


  The `swaggerModelCodeGen`, `swaggerServerCodeGen` and `swaggerClientCodeGen` will run automatically when the swagger sources change.


  ## Keys (and defaults)


  These keys influence properties of the generated code itself:


  - `swaggerSourcesDir` -> "/src/main/swagger" (path where to search for swagger files)

  - `swaggerCodeGenPackage` -> "swagger.codegen" (package name of the generated sources)

  - `swaggerModelFileSplitting` -> "oneFilePerSource" (in model generation how to group classes in '.scala' files available options are "oneFilePerSource" "oneFilePerModel")

  - `swaggerCodeProvidedPackage` -> "com.yourcompany" (where you will provide business logic server method implementation)


  These keys determine where generated files will be put:


  - `swaggerModelCodeTargetDir` -> "target/scala-2.1x/src_managed/src/main/swagger/model" (path where to put generated model files)

  - `swaggerClientCodeTargetDir` -> "target/scala-2.1x/src_managed/src/main/swagger/client" (path where to put generated client code files)

  - `swaggerServerCodeTargetDir` -> "target/scala-2.1x/src_managed/src/main/swagger/server" (path where to put generated server code files)


  These keys can be used to determine what kind of code should be generated:


  - `swaggerGenerateModel` -> true (to be disabled if you do not want model classes to be generated automatically when swagger source code changes)

  - `swaggerGenerateJsonRW` -> true (if you want to generate json Format for your model case classes)

  - `swaggerGenerateClient` -> false (enable this if you want client code to ge generated automatically when swagger source code changes)

  - `swaggerGenerateServer` -> false (enable this if you want client code to ge generated automatically when swagger source code changes)


  Moreover, you can extend this plugin by providing alternative implementations of the generators via:


  - `swaggerModelCodeGenClass` -> new eu.unicredit.swagger.generators.DefaultModelGenerator() (the class used to generate the model classes)

  - `swaggerJsonCodeGenClass` -> new eu.unicredit.swagger.generators.DefaultJsonGenerator() (the class used to generate the json marshaller/unmarshaller)

  - `swaggerServerCodeGenClass` -> new eu.unicredit.swagger.generators.DefaultServerGenerator() (the class used to generate the Server classes)

  - `swaggerClientCodeGenClass` -> new eu.unicredit.swagger.generators.DefaultClientGenerator() (the class used to generate the client classes)


  ## Dependencies


  - scala version 2.12.X

  - [play-ws-standalone-json 1.1.3](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.typesafe.play/play-ws-standalone-json)

  - [play-ahc-ws-standalone 1.1.3](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.typesafe.play/play-ahc-ws-standalone) (only if you use client)


  ### Limitations


  At the moment the project is developed to fulfill some internal projects needs, so do not expect it to cover all the corner cases of the Swagger Spec (i.e. some primitive types in body req or resp).


  ## The road ahead


  We are actively working with and on this project, trying to overcome any arising limitations and support all Swagger-spec properties we need.

  PRs are really welcome and please open an Issue if you find that something is not working.

  swagger-parser

  ==============


  Swagger-parser is a python module giving you access to some interesting data about your swagger file. Like getting a dictionary example from a definition name, get the definition of a dictionary, and more.


  Related Libraries

  -----------------

  You may find related libraries to this one:


  * https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-tester: Auto-test your swagger API in your unit tests. All test calls are generated by your swagger file.

  * https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-stub: A stub you can use in your client's unit tests. All the HTTP calls to your swagger API are mocked by default. You can also add your own mocked_calls in your test functions.

  * https://github.com/Trax-air/swagger-aggregator: Aggregate several swagger specs into one. Useful for your API gateways!


  Example Usage

  -------------


  .. code:: python

    from swagger_parser import SwaggerParser

    parser = SwaggerParser(swagger_path='swagger_path')  # Init with file
    parser = SwaggerParser(swagger_dict={})  # Init with dictionary

    # Get an example of dict for the definition Foo
    parser.definitions_example.get('Foo')

    # Get the definition of a dictionary
    test = {
      'foo': 'bar'
    }
    parser.get_dict_definition(test)

    # Validate the definition of a dict
    parser.validate_definition('Foo', test)

    # Validate that the given data match a path specification
    parser.validate_request('/foo', 'post', body=test, query={'foo': 'bar'})

    # Get the possible return value of a path
    # It will return a dictionary with keys as status_code
    # and value as example of return value.
    parser.get_request_data('/foo', 'post', body=test)

    # Get an example of a correct body for a path
    parser.get_send_request_correct_body('/foo', 'post')

  [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CacheControl/hippie-swagger.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/CacheControl/hippie-swagger)

  ## Synopsis


  ```hippie-swagger``` is a tool for testing RESTful APIs.  In addition to validating api behavior, it will fail tests when swagger documentation is missing or inaccurate.


  As the test suite runs, any request or response details *not* matching the swagger file will throw an appropriate exception, failing the spec.  This ensures the swagger definition accurately describes application behavior, keeping documentation in sync with reality.


  ```hippie-swagger``` uses [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) under the hood, an excellent API testing tool.


  ## Features


  * All [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) features included

  * All aspects of swagger file validated; parameters, request/response body, paths, etc.

  * Checks for extra parameters, paths, headers, etc not mentioned in the swagger file

  * Ensures swagger file accurately describes API behavior

  * Accurate, human readable assertion messages


  ## Installation


  ```

  npm install hippie-swagger --save-dev

  ```


  ## Basic Usage


  ```js

  var hippie = require('hippie-swagger'),
      swagger = require('./my-dereferenced-swagger-file'); // see example for how to dereference swagger

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{username}')

  .pathParams({
    username: 'cachecontrol'
  })

  .expectStatus(200)

  .expectValue('user.first', 'John')

  .expectHeader('cache-control', 'no-cache')

  .end(function(err, res, body) {
    if (err) throw err;
  });

  ```


  ## Usage

  * See [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) documentation for a description of the base api

  * When specifying a url(.get, .post, .patch, .url, etc), use the [swagger path](http://swagger.io/specification/#pathsObject)

  * Provide any path variables using [pathParams](#pathparams)


  These aside, use hippie as you normally would; see the [example](example/index.js).


  ## Methods


  ### #constructor (Object app, Object swagger, Object [options])


  Test an HTTP app (like express) directly


  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger, options)

  .get('/projects')

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ### #constructor (Object swagger, Object [options])


  Test a remote HTTP app using a fully qualified url


  ```js

  hippie(swagger, options)

  .get('http://localhost:3000/projects')

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ### #pathParams(Object hash)


  Replaces variables contained in the swagger path.


  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}')

  .pathParams({
    projectId: 123,
    taskId: 99
  })

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ## Options


  To customize behavior, an ```options``` hash may be passed to the constructor.  Typically, ```options``` only need to be specified in situations where the test covers responses to improper requests (e.g. validating the application returns a 422 when a required parameter is not provided).


  ```js

  var options = {
    validateResponseSchema: true,
    validateParameterSchema: true,
    errorOnExtraParameters: true,
    errorOnExtraHeaderParameters: false
  };

  hippie(app, swagger, options)

  ```


  ```validateResponseSchema``` - Validate the server's response against the swagger json-schema definition (default: ```true```)


  ```validateParameterSchema``` - Validate the request parameters against the swagger json-schema definition (default: ```true```)


  ```validateRequiredParameters``` - Validate that required parameters were provided  (default: ```true```)


  ```errorOnExtraParameters``` - Throw an error if a parameter is missing from the swagger file  (default: ```true```)


  ```errorOnExtraHeaderParameters``` - Throw an error if a request header is missing from the swagger file.  By default this is turned off, because it results in every request needing to specify the "Content-Type" and "Accept" headers, which quickly becomes verbose. (default: ```false```)



  ## Example

  See the [example](example/index.js) folder


  ## Validations


  When hippie-swagger detects it is interacting with the app in ways not specified in the swagger file, it will throw an error and fail the test.  The idea is to use hippie's core features to write API tests as per usual, and hippie-swagger will only interject if the swagger contract is violated.


  Below are list of some of the validations that hippie-swagger checks for:


  ### Paths

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/pathNotMentionedInSwagger')

  .end(fn);

  // path does not exist in swagger file; throws:

  //    Swagger spec does not define path: pathNotMentionedInSwagger

  ```


  ### Parameter format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{userId}')

  .pathParams({
    userId: 'string-value',
  })

  .end(fn);

  // userId provided as a string, but swagger specifies it as an integer; throws:

  //    Invalid format for parameter {userId}

  ```


  ### Required Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{username}')

  .end(fn);

  // "username" is marked 'required' in swagger file; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in path: username

  ```


  ### Extraneous Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users')

  .qs({ page: 2, limit: 30 })

  .end(fn);

  // "page" missing from swagger file; throws:

  //    Error: query parameter not mentioned in swagger spec: "page", available params: limit

  ```


  ### Response format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users')

  .end(fn);

  // body failed to validate against swagger file's "response" schema; throws:

  //    Response from /users failed validation: [failure description]

  ```


  ### Method validation

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .post('/users')

  .end(fn);

  // "post" method not mentioned in swagger file; throws:

  //    Swagger spec does not define method: "post" in path /users

  ```


  ### Post body format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .post('/users')

  .send({"bogus":"post-body"})

  .end(fn);


  // post body fails to validate against swagger file's "body" parameter; throws:

  //    Invalid format for parameter {body}, received: {"bogus":"post-body"}

  ```


  ### Form Url-Encoded Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .form()

  .post('/users')

  .send({})

  .end(fn);


  // "username" is {required: true, in: formData} in swagger; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in formData: username

  ```


  ### Multipart Forms

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .header('Content-Type','multipart/form-data')

  .send()

  .post('/users/upload')

  .end(fn);


  // "fileUpload" is {required: true, in: formData, type: file} in swagger; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in formData: fileUpload

  ```


  ## Troubleshooting


  The most common mistake is forgetting to dereference the swagger file:


  ```js

  "'Error: cant resolve reference ...'

  ```


  Dereferencing can be accomplished using [swagger-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-parser/blob/master/docs/swagger-parser.md#dereferenceapi-options-callback).  The [example](example/index.js) gives a demonstration.

  OpenApi 3.0 and Swagger 2.0 compatible!


  Rswag extends rspec-rails "request specs" with a Swagger-based DSL for describing and testing API operations. You describe your API operations with a succinct, intuitive syntax, and it automaticaly runs the tests. Once you have green tests, run a rake task to auto-generate corresponding Swagger files and expose them as YAML or JSON endpoints. Rswag also provides an embedded version of the awesome [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) that's powered by the exposed file. This toolchain makes it seamless to go from integration specs, which youre probably doing in some form already, to living documentation for your API consumers.


  Api Rswag creates [Swagger](http://swagger.io) tooling for Rails API's. Generate beautiful API documentation, including a UI to explore and test operations, directly from your rspec integration tests.



  And that's not all ...


  Once you have an API that can describe itself in Swagger, you've opened the treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be targeted to a wide range of popular platforms. See [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for more details.

  ## Getting Started ##


  1. Add this line to your applications _Gemfile_:

      ```ruby
      gem 'rswag'
      ```

      or if you like to avoid loading rspec in other bundler groups load the rswag-specs component separately.
      Note: Adding it to the :development group is not strictly necessary, but without it, generators and rake tasks must be preceded by RAILS_ENV=test.

      ```ruby
      # Gemfile
      gem 'rswag-api'
      gem 'rswag-ui'

      group :development, :test do
        gem 'rspec-rails'
        gem 'rswag-specs'
      end
      ```

  2. Run the install generator

      ```ruby
      rails g rswag:install
      ```

      Or run the install generators for each package separately if you installed Rswag as separate gems, as indicated above:

      ```ruby
      rails g rswag:api:install
      rails g rswag:ui:install
      RAILS_ENV=test rails g rswag:specs:install
      ```

  3. Create an integration spec to describe and test your API.

  There is also a generator which can help get you started `rails generate rspec:swagger API::MyController`

      ```ruby
      # spec/integration/blogs_spec.rb
      require 'swagger_helper'

      describe 'Blogs API' do

        path '/blogs' do

          post 'Creates a blog' do
            tags 'Blogs'
            consumes 'application/json'
            parameter name: :blog, in: :body, schema: {
              type: :object,
              properties: {
                title: { type: :string },
                content: { type: :string }
              },
              required: [ 'title', 'content' ]
            }

            response '201', 'blog created' do
              let(:blog) { { title: 'foo', content: 'bar' } }
              run_test!
            end

            response '422', 'invalid request' do
              let(:blog) { { title: 'foo' } }
              run_test!
            end
          end
        end

        path '/blogs/{id}' do

          get 'Retrieves a blog' do
            tags 'Blogs'
            produces 'application/json', 'application/xml'
            parameter name: :id, in: :path, type: :string

            response '200', 'blog found' do
              schema type: :object,
                properties: {
                  id: { type: :integer },
                  title: { type: :string },
                  content: { type: :string }
                },
                required: [ 'id', 'title', 'content' ]

              let(:id) { Blog.create(title: 'foo', content: 'bar').id }
              run_test!
            end

            response '404', 'blog not found' do
              let(:id) { 'invalid' }
              run_test!
            end

            response '406', 'unsupported accept header' do
              let(:'Accept') { 'application/foo' }
              run_test!
            end
          end
        end
      end
      ```


  4. Generate the Swagger JSON file(s)

      ```ruby
      rake rswag:specs:swaggerize
      ```

      This common command is also aliased as `rake rswag`.

      Or if you installed your gems separately:
      ```
      RAILS_ENV=test rails rswag
      ```

  5. Spin up your app and check out the awesome, auto-generated docs at _/api-docs_!


  ## The rspec DSL ##


  ### Paths, Operations and Responses ###


  If you've used [Swagger](http://swagger.io/specification) before, then the syntax should be very familiar. To describe your API operations, start by specifying a path and then list the supported operations (i.e. HTTP verbs) for that path. Path parameters must be surrounded by curly braces ({}). Within an operation block (see "post" or "get" in the example above), most of the fields supported by the [Swagger "Operation" object](http://swagger.io/specification/#operationObject) are available as methods on the example group. To list (and test) the various responses for an operation, create one or more response blocks. Again, you can reference the [Swagger "Response" object](http://swagger.io/specification/#responseObject) for available fields.


  Take special note of the __run_test!__ method that's called within each response block. This tells rswag to create and execute a corresponding example. It builds and submits a request based on parameter descriptions and corresponding values that have been provided using the rspec "let" syntax. For example, the "post" description in the example above specifies a "body" parameter called "blog". It also lists 2 different responses. For the success case (i.e. the 201 response), notice how "let" is used to set the blog parameter to a value that matches the provided schema. For the failure case (i.e. the 422 response), notice how it's set to a value that does not match the provided schema. When the test is executed, rswag also validates the actual response code and, where applicable, the response body against the provided [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html).


  If you want to do additional validation on the response, pass a block to the __run_test!__ method:


  ```ruby

  response '201', 'blog created' do
    run_test! do |response|
      data = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(data['title']).to eq('foo')
    end
  end

  ```


  If you'd like your specs to be a little more explicit about what's going on here, you can replace the call to __run_test!__ with equivalent "before" and "it" blocks:


  ```ruby

  response '201', 'blog created' do
    let(:blog) { { title: 'foo', content: 'bar' } }

    before do |example|
      submit_request(example.metadata)
    end

    it 'returns a valid 201 response' do |example|
      assert_response_matches_metadata(example.metadata)
    end
  end

  ```


  ### Null Values ###


  This library is currently using JSON::Draft4 for validation of response models. Nullable properties can be supported with the non-standard property 'x-nullable' to a definition to allow null/nil values to pass. Or you can add the new standard ```nullable``` property to a definition.

  ```ruby

  describe 'Blogs API' do
    path '/blogs' do
      post 'Creates a blog' do
        ...

        response '200', 'blog found' do
          schema type: :object,
            properties: {
              id: { type: :integer },
              title: { type: :string, nullable: true }, # preferred syntax
              content: { type: :string, 'x-nullable': true } # legacy syntax, but still works
            }
          ....
        end
      end
    end
  end

  ```


  ### Support for oneOf, anyOf or AllOf schemas ###


  Open API 3.0 now supports more flexible schema validation with the ```oneOf```, ```anyOf``` and ```allOf``` directives. rswag will handle these definitions and validate them properly.



  Notice the ```schema``` inside the ```response``` section. Placing a ```schema``` method inside the response will validate (and fail the tests)

  if during the integration test run the endpoint response does not match the response schema. This test validation can handle anyOf and allOf as well. See below:


  ```ruby

    path '/blogs/flexible' do
      post 'Creates a blog flexible body' do
        tags 'Blogs'
        description 'Creates a flexible blog from provided data'
        operationId 'createFlexibleBlog'
        consumes 'application/json'
        produces 'application/json'

        parameter name: :blog, in: :body, schema: {
            oneOf: [
              { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog' },
              { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/flexible_blog' }
            ]
          }

        response '201', 'flexible blog created' do
          schema oneOf: [{ '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog' }, { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/flexible_blog' }]
          run_test!
        end
      end
    end

  ```

  This automatic schema validation is a powerful feature of rswag.


  ### Global Metadata ###


  In addition to paths, operations and responses, Swagger also supports global API metadata. When you install rswag, a file called _swagger_helper.rb_ is added to your spec folder. This is where you define one or more Swagger documents and provide global metadata. Again, the format is based on Swagger so most of the global fields supported by the top level ["Swagger" object](http://swagger.io/specification/#swaggerObject) can be provided with each document definition. As an example, you could define a Swagger document for each version of your API and in each case specify a title, version string. In Open API 3.0 the pathing and server definitions have changed a bit [Swagger host/basePath](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/):


  ```ruby

  # spec/swagger_helper.rb

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.swagger_root = Rails.root.to_s + '/swagger'

    config.swagger_docs = {
      'v1/swagger.json' => {
        openapi: '3.0.1',
        info: {
          title: 'API V1',
          version: 'v1',
          description: 'This is the first version of my API'
        },
        servers: [
          {
            url: 'https://{defaultHost}',
            variables: {
              defaultHost: {
                  default: 'www.example.com'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      },

      'v2/swagger.yaml' => {
        openapi: '3.0.1',
        info: {
          title: 'API V2',
          version: 'v2',
          description: 'This is the second version of my API'
        },
        servers: [
          {
            url: 'https://{defaultHost}',
            variables: {
              defaultHost: {
                  default: 'www.example.com'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  end

  ```


  #### Supporting multiple versions of API ####

  By default, the paths, operations and responses defined in your spec files will be associated with the first Swagger document in _swagger_helper.rb_. If your API has multiple versions, you should be using separate documents to describe each of them. In order to assign a file with a given version of API, you'll need to add the ```swagger_doc``` tag to each spec specifying its target document name:


  ```ruby

  # spec/integration/v2/blogs_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API', swagger_doc: 'v2/swagger.yaml' do

    path '/blogs' do
    ...

    path '/blogs/{id}' do
    ...
  end

  ```


  #### Formatting the description literals: ####

  Swagger supports the Markdown syntax to format strings. This can be especially handy if you were to provide a long description of a given API version or endpoint. Use [this guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for reference.


  __NOTE:__ There is one difference between the official Markdown syntax and Swagger interpretation, namely tables. To create a table like this:


  | Column1 | Collumn2 |

  | ------- | -------- |

  | cell1   | cell2    |


  you should use the folowing syntax, making sure there are no whitespaces at the start of any of the lines:


  ```

  &#13;

  | Column1 | Collumn2 |&#13;

  | ------- | -------- |&#13;

  | cell1   | cell2    |&#13;

  &#13;

  ```


  ### Specifying/Testing API Security ###


  Swagger allows for the specification of different security schemes and their applicability to operations in an API. 

  To leverage this in rswag, you define the schemes globally in _swagger_helper.rb_ and then use the "security" attribute at the operation level to specify which schemes, if any, are applicable to that operation. 

  Swagger supports :basic, :bearer, :apiKey and :oauth2 and :openIdConnect scheme types. See [the spec](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) for more info, as this underwent major changes between Swagger 2.0 and Open API 3.0


  ```ruby

  # spec/swagger_helper.rb

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.swagger_root = Rails.root.to_s + '/swagger'

    config.swagger_docs = {
      'v1/swagger.json' => {
        ...  # note the new Open API 3.0 compliant security structure here, under "components"
        components: {
          securitySchemes: {
            basic_auth: {
              type: :http,
              scheme: :basic
            },
            api_key: {
              type: :apiKey,
              name: 'api_key',
              in: :query
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  end


  # spec/integration/blogs_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs' do

      post 'Creates a blog' do
        tags 'Blogs'
        security [ basic_auth: [] ]
        ...

        response '201', 'blog created' do
          let(:Authorization) { "Basic #{::Base64.strict_encode64('jsmith:jspass')}" }
          run_test!
        end

        response '401', 'authentication failed' do
          let(:Authorization) { "Basic #{::Base64.strict_encode64('bogus:bogus')}" }
          run_test!
        end
      end
    end
  end


  # example of documenting an endpoint that handles basic auth and api key based security

  describe 'Auth examples API' do 
    path '/auth-tests/basic-and-api-key' do
      post 'Authenticates with basic auth and api key' do
        tags 'Auth Tests'
        operationId 'testBasicAndApiKey'
        security [{ basic_auth: [], api_key: [] }]

        response '204', 'Valid credentials' do
          let(:Authorization) { "Basic #{::Base64.strict_encode64('jsmith:jspass')}" }
          let(:api_key) { 'foobar' }
          run_test!
        end

        response '401', 'Invalid credentials' do
          let(:Authorization) { "Basic #{::Base64.strict_encode64('jsmith:jspass')}" }
          let(:api_key) { 'barfoo' }
          run_test!
        end
      end
    end
  end
   

  ```


  __NOTE:__ Depending on the scheme types, you'll be required to assign a corresponding parameter value with each example. 

  For example, :basic auth is required above and so the :Authorization (header) parameter must be set accordingly


  ## Configuration & Customization ##


  The steps described above will get you up and running with minimal setup. However, rswag offers a lot of flexibility to customize as you see fit. Before exploring the various options, you'll need to be aware of it's different components. The following table lists each of them and the files that get added/updated as part of a standard install.


  |Gem|Description|Added/Updated|

  |---------|-----------|-------------|

  |__rswag-specs__|Swagger-based DSL for rspec & accompanying rake task for generating Swagger files|_spec/swagger_helper.rb_|

  |__rswag-api__  |Rails Engine that exposes your Swagger files as JSON endpoints|_config/initializers/rswag_api.rb, config/routes.rb_|

  |__rswag-ui__   |Rails Engine that includes [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) and powers it from your Swagger endpoints|_config/initializers/rswag-ui.rb, config/routes.rb_|


  ### Output Location for Generated Swagger Files ###


  You can adjust this in the _swagger_helper.rb_ that's installed with __rswag-specs__:


  ```ruby

  # spec/swagger_helper.rb

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.swagger_root = Rails.root.to_s + '/your-custom-folder-name'
    ...
  end

  ```


  __NOTE__: If you do change this, you'll also need to update the rswag_api.rb initializer (assuming you're using rswag-api). More on this later.


  ### Input Location for Rspec Tests ###


  By default, rswag will search for integration tests in _spec/requests_, _spec/api_ and _spec/integration_. If you want to use tests from other locations, provide the PATTERN argument to rake:


  ```ruby

  # search for tests in spec/swagger

  rake rswag:specs:swaggerize PATTERN="spec/swagger/**/*_spec.rb"

  ```


  ### Referenced Parameters and Schema Definitions ###


  Swagger allows you to describe JSON structures inline with your operation descriptions OR as referenced globals. 

  For example, you might have a standard response structure for all failed operations.

  Again, this is a structure that changed since swagger 2.0. Notice the new "schemas" section for these. 

  Rather than repeating the schema in every operation spec, you can define it globally and provide a reference to it in each spec:


  ```ruby

  # spec/swagger_helper.rb

  config.swagger_docs = {
    'v1/swagger.json' => {
      openapi: '3.0.0',
      info: {
        title: 'API V1'
      },
      components: {
        schemas: {
          errors_object: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              errors: { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/errors_map' }
            }
          },
          errors_map: {
            type: 'object',
            additionalProperties: {
              type: 'array',
              items: { type: 'string' }
            }
          },
          blog: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              id: { type: 'integer' },
              title: { type: 'string' },
              content: { type: 'string', nullable: true },
              thumbnail: { type: 'string', nullable: true }
            },
            required: %w[id title]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }


  # spec/integration/blogs_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs' do

      post 'Creates a blog' do

        response 422, 'invalid request' do
          schema '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/errors_object'
    ...
  end


  # spec/integration/comments_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs/{blog_id}/comments' do

      post 'Creates a comment' do

        response 422, 'invalid request' do
          schema '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/errors_object'
    ...
  end

  ```


  ### Response headers ###


  In Rswag, you could use `header` method inside the response block to specify header objects for this response. 

  Rswag will validate your response headers with those header objects and inject them into the generated swagger file:


  ```ruby

  # spec/integration/comments_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs/{blog_id}/comments' do

      post 'Creates a comment' do

        response 422, 'invalid request' do
          header 'X-Rate-Limit-Limit', type: :integer, description: 'The number of allowed requests in the current period'
          header 'X-Rate-Limit-Remaining', type: :integer, description: 'The number of remaining requests in the current period'
    ...
  end

  ```


  ### Response examples ###


  You can provide custom response examples to the generated swagger file by calling the method `examples` inside the response block:

  However, auto generated example responses are now enabled by default in rswag. See below.

  ```ruby

  # spec/integration/blogs_spec.rb

  describe 'Blogs API' do

    path '/blogs/{blog_id}' do

      get 'Retrieves a blog' do

        response 200, 'blog found' do
          examples 'application/json' => {
              id: 1,
              title: 'Hello world!',
              content: '...'
            }
    ...
  end

  ```



  ### Enable auto generation examples from responses ###



  To enable examples generation from responses add callback above run_test! like:


  ```

  after do |example|
    example.metadata[:response][:examples] = { 'application/json' => JSON.parse(response.body, symbolize_names: true) }
  end

  ```


  You need to disable --dry-run option for Rspec > 3


  <!-- This is now enabled by default in rswag. 

  You need to set the ``` config.swagger_dry_run = false``` value in the spec/spec_helper.rb file.

  This is one of the more powerful features of rswag. When rswag runs your integration test suite via ```bundle exec rspec```, it will capture the request and response bodies and output those values in the examples section.

  These integration tests are usually written with ```let``` variables for post body parameters, and since its an integration test the service is returning actual values. 

  We might as well re-use these values and embed them into the generated swagger to provide a more real world example for request/response examples. -->


  Add to config/environments/test.rb:

  ```ruby

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.swagger_dry_run = false
  end

  ```


  #### Running tests without documenting ####


  If you want to use Rswag for testing without adding it to you swagger docs, you can provide the document tag:

  ```ruby

  describe 'Blogs API' do
    path '/blogs/{blog_id}' do
      get 'Retrieves a blog' do
        # documentation is now disabled for this response only
        response 200, 'blog found', document: false do
          ...
  ```


  You can also reenable documentation for specific responses only:

  ```ruby

  # documentation is now disabled

  describe 'Blogs API', document: false do
    path '/blogs/{blog_id}' do
      get 'Retrieves a blog' do
        # documentation is reenabled for this response only
        response 200, 'blog found', document: true do
          ...
        end

        response 401, 'special case' do
          ...
        end
  ```


  ##### rswag helper methods #####

  <!-- 

  There are some helper methods to help with documenting request bodies. 

  ```ruby

  describe 'Blogs API', type: :request, swagger_doc: 'v1/swagger.json' do
    let(:api_key) { 'fake_key' }

    path '/blogs' do
      post 'Creates a blog' do
        tags 'Blogs'
        description 'Creates a new blog from provided data'
        operationId 'createBlog'
        consumes 'application/json'
        produces 'application/json'

        request_body_json schema: { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog' },
                          examples: :blog

        request_body_text_plain
        request_body_xml schema: { '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog' }

        let(:blog) { { blog: { title: 'foo', content: 'bar' } } }

        response '201', 'blog created' do
          schema '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/blog'
          run_test!
        end

        response '422', 'invalid request' do
          schema '$ref' => '#/components/schemas/errors_object'
          let(:blog) { { blog: { title: 'foo' } } }

          run_test! do |response|
            expect(response.body).to include("can't be blank")
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end    

  ```


  In the above example, we see methods ```request_body_json``` ```request_body_plain``` ```request_body_xml```.

  These methods can be used to describe json, plain text and xml body. They are just wrapper methods to setup posting JSON, plain text or xml into your endpoint.

  The simplest most common usage is for json formatted body to use the schema: to specify the location of the schema for the request body

  and the examples: :blog which will create a named example "blog" under the "requestBody / content / application/json / examples" section.

  Again, documenting request response examples changed in Open API 3.0. The example above would generate a swagger.json snippet that looks like this:


  ```json
          ... 
          {"requestBody": {
            "required": true,
            "content": {
              "application/json": {
                "examples": {
                  "blog": {  // takes the name from  examples: :blog above
                    "value": {  //this is open api 3.0 structure -> https://swagger.io/docs/specification/adding-examples/
                      "blog": { // here is the actual JSON payload that is submitted to the service, and shows up in swagger UI as an example
                        "title": "foo",
                        "content": "bar"
                      }
                    }
                  }
                },
                "schema": {
                  "$ref": "#/components/schemas/blog"
                }
              },
              "test/plain": {
                "schema": {
                  "type": "string"
                }
              },
              "application/xml": {
                "schema": {
                  "$ref": "#/components/schemas/blog"
                }
              }
            }
          },
          }
  ```


  *NOTE:* for this example request body to work in the tests properly, you need to ``let`` a variable named *blog*. 

  The variable with the matching name (blog in this case) is eval-ed and captured to be placed in the examples section.

  This ```let``` value is used in the integration test to run the test AND captured and injected into the requestBody section. 


  ##### rswag response examples #####


  In the same way that requestBody examples can be captured and injected into the swagger output, response examples can also be captured.

  Using the above example, when the integration test is run - the swagger would include the following snippet providing more useful real world examples

  capturing the response from the execution of the integration test. Again 3.0 swagger changed the structure of how these are documented.


  ```json
         ...  "responses": {
            "201": {
              "description": "blog created",
              "content": {
                "application/json": {
                  "example": {
                    "id": 1,
                    "title": "foo",
                    "content": "bar",
                    "thumbnail": null
                  },
                  "schema": {
                    "$ref": "#/components/schemas/blog"
                  }
                }
              }
            },
            "422": {
              "description": "invalid request",
              "content": {
                "application/json": {
                  "example": {
                    "errors": {
                      "content": [
                        "can't be blank"
                      ]
                    }
                  },
                  "schema": {
                    "$ref": "#/components/schemas/errors_object"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
  ```
   -->
  ### Route Prefix for Swagger JSON Endpoints ###


  The functionality to expose Swagger files, such as those generated by rswag-specs, as JSON endpoints is implemented as a Rails Engine. As with any Engine, you can change it's mount prefix in _routes.rb_:


  ```ruby

  TestApp::Application.routes.draw do
    ...

    mount Rswag::Api::Engine => 'your-custom-prefix'
  end

  ```


  Assuming a Swagger file exists at &lt;swagger_root&gt;/v1/swagger.json, this configuration would expose the file as the following JSON endpoint:


  ```

  GET http://<hostname>/your-custom-prefix/v1/swagger.json

  ```


  ### Root Location for Swagger Files ###


  You can adjust this in the _rswag_api.rb_ initializer that's installed with __rspec-api__:


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Api.configure do |c|
    c.swagger_root = Rails.root.to_s + '/your-custom-folder-name'
    ...
  end

  ```


  __NOTE__: If you're using rswag-specs to generate Swagger files, you'll want to ensure they both use the same &lt;swagger_root&gt;. The reason for separate settings is to maintain independence between the two gems. For example, you could install rswag-api independently and create your Swagger files manually.


  ### Dynamic Values for Swagger JSON ##


  There may be cases where you need to add dynamic values to the Swagger JSON that's returned by rswag-api. For example, you may want to provide an explicit host name. Rather than hardcoding it, you can configure a filter that's executed prior to serializing every Swagger document:


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Api.configure do |c|
    ...

    c.swagger_filter = lambda { |swagger, env| swagger['host'] = env['HTTP_HOST'] }
  end

  ```


  Note how the filter is passed the rack env for the current request. This provides a lot of flexibilty. For example, you can assign the "host" property (as shown) or you could inspect session information or an Authorization header and remove operations based on user permissions.


  ### Custom Headers for Swagger Files ###


  You can specify custom headers for serving your generated Swagger JSON. For example you may want to force a specific charset for the 'Content-Type' header. You can configure a hash of headers to be sent with the request:


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Api.configure do |c|
    ...
    
    c.swagger_headers = { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' }
  end

  ```


  Take care when overriding Content-Type if you serve both YAML and JSON files as it will no longer switch the Content-Type header correctly.



  ### Enable Swagger Endpoints for swagger-ui ###


  You can update the _rswag-ui.rb_ initializer, installed with rswag-ui, to specify which Swagger endpoints should be available to power the documentation UI. If you're using rswag-api, these should correspond to the Swagger endpoints it exposes. When the UI is rendered, you'll see these listed in a drop-down to the top right of the page:


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Ui.configure do |c|
    c.swagger_endpoint '/api-docs/v1/swagger.json', 'API V1 Docs'
    c.swagger_endpoint '/api-docs/v2/swagger.json', 'API V2 Docs'
  end

  ```


  ### Enable Simple Basic Auth for swagger-ui


  You can also update the _rswag-ui.rb_ initializer, installed with rswag-ui to specify a username and password should you want to keep your documentation private.


  ```ruby

  Rswag::Ui.configure do |c|
    c.basic_auth_enabled = true
    c.basic_auth_credentials 'username', 'password'
  end

  ```


  ### Route Prefix for the swagger-ui ###


  Similar to rswag-api, you can customize the swagger-ui path by changing it's mount prefix in _routes.rb_:


  ```ruby

  TestApp::Application.routes.draw do
    ...

    mount Rswag::Api::Engine => 'api-docs'
    mount Rswag::Ui::Engine => 'your-custom-prefix'
  end

  ```


  ### Customizing the swagger-ui ###


  The swagger-ui provides several options for customizing it's behavior, all of which are documented here https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x#swaggerui. If you need to tweak these or customize the overall look and feel of your swagger-ui, then you'll need to provide your own version of index.html. You can do this with the following generator.


  ```ruby

  rails g rswag:ui:custom


  ```


  This will add a local version that you can modify at _app/views/rswag/ui/home/index.html.erb_


  ### Serve UI Assets Directly from your Web Server


  Rswag ships with an embedded version of the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui), which is a static collection of JavaScript and CSS files. These assets are served by the rswag-ui middleware. However, for optimal performance you may want to serve them directly from your web server (e.g. Apache or NGINX). To do this, you'll need to copy them to the web server root. This is the "public" folder in a typical Rails application.


  ```

  bundle exec rake rswag:ui:copy_assets[public/api-docs]

  ```


  __NOTE:__: The provided subfolder MUST correspond to the UI mount prefix - "api-docs" by default.



  Notes to test swagger output locally with swagger editor

  ```

  docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-editor

  ```

  ```

  docker run -d -p 80:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-editor

  ```

  This will run the swagger editor in the docker daemon and can be accessed 

  at ```http://localhost```. From here, you can use the UI to load the generated swagger.json to validate the output.

  Connexion is a framework that automagically handles HTTP requests based on `OpenAPI Specification`_

  (formerly known as Swagger Spec) of your API described in `YAML format`_. Connexion allows you to

  write an OpenAPI specification, then maps the endpoints to your Python functions; this makes it

  unique, as many tools generate the specification based on your Python code. You can describe your

  REST API in as much detail as you want; then Connexion guarantees that it will work as you

  specified.


  We built Connexion this way in order to:


  - simplify the development process

  - confirm expectations about what your API will look like


  Connexion Features:

  -------------------


  - Validates requests and endpoint parameters automatically, based on
    your specification
  - Provides a Web Swagger Console UI so that the users of your API can
    have live documentation and even call your API's endpoints
    through it
  - Handles OAuth 2 token-based authentication

  - Supports API versioning

  - Supports automatic serialization of payloads. If your
    specification defines that an endpoint returns JSON, Connexion will
    automatically serialize the return value for you and set the right
    content type in the HTTP header.

  Why Connexion

  -------------


  With Connexion, you write the spec first. Connexion then calls your Python

  code, handling the mapping from the specification to the code. This

  incentivizes you to write the specification so that all of your

  developers can understand what your API does, even before you write a

  single line of code.


  If multiple teams depend on your APIs, you can use Connexion to easily send them the documentation of your API. This guarantees that your API will follow the specification that you wrote. This is a different process from that offered by frameworks such as Hug_, which generates a specification *after* you've written the code. Some disadvantages of generating specifications based on code is that they often end up lacking details or mix your documentation with the code logic of your application.

  - Connexion listed on Swagger_'s website

  - Blog post: `Crafting effective Microservices in Python`_


  New in Connexion 2.0:

  ---------------------

  - App and Api options must be provided through the "options" argument (``old_style_options`` have been removed).

  - You must specify a form content-type in 'consumes' in order to consume form data.

  - The `Operation` interface has been formalized in the `AbstractOperation` class.

  - The `Operation` class has been renamed to `Swagger2Operation`.

  - Array parameter deserialization now follows the Swagger 2.0 spec more closely.
    In situations when a query parameter is passed multiple times, and the collectionFormat is either csv or pipes, the right-most value will be used.
    For example, `?q=1,2,3&q=4,5,6` will result in `q = [4, 5, 6]`.
    The old behavior is available by setting the collectionFormat to `multi`, or by importing `decorators.uri_parsing.AlwaysMultiURIParser` and passing `parser_class=AlwaysMultiURIParser` to your Api.
  - The spec validator library has changed from `swagger-spec-validator` to `openapi-spec-validator`.

  - Errors that previously raised `SwaggerValidationError` now raise the `InvalidSpecification` exception.
    All spec validation errors should be wrapped with `InvalidSpecification`.
  - Support for nullable/x-nullable, readOnly and writeOnly/x-writeOnly has been added to the standard json schema validator.

  - Custom validators can now be specified on api level (instead of app level).

  - Added support for basic authentication and apikey authentication

  - If unsupported security requirements are defined or ``x-tokenInfoFunc``/``x-tokenInfoUrl`` is missing, connexion now denies requests instead of allowing access without security-check.

  - Accessing ``connexion.request.user`` / ``flask.request.user`` is no longer supported, use ``connexion.context['user']`` instead


  How to Use

  ==========


  Prerequisites

  -------------


  Python 3.6+


  Installing It

  -------------


  In your command line, type:


  .. code-block:: bash

      $ pip install connexion

  Running It

  ----------


  Place your API YAML inside a folder in the root

  path of your application (e.g ``swagger/``). Then run:


  .. code-block:: python

      import connexion

      app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='swagger/')
      app.add_api('my_api.yaml')
      app.run(port=8080)

  See the `Connexion Pet Store Example Application`_ for a sample

  specification.


  Now you're able to run and use Connexion!



  OAuth 2 Authentication and Authorization

  ----------------------------------------


  Connexion supports one of the three OAuth 2 handling methods. (See

  "TODO" below.) With Connexion, the API security definition **must**

  include a 'x-tokenInfoUrl' or 'x-tokenInfoFunc (or set ``TOKENINFO_URL``

  or ``TOKENINFO_FUNC`` env var respectively). 'x-tokenInfoUrl' must contain an

  URL to validate and get the `token information`_ and 'x-tokenInfoFunc must

  contain a reference to a function used to obtain the token info. When both 'x-tokenInfoUrl'

  and 'x-tokenInfoFunc' are used, Connexion will prioritize the function method. Connexion expects to

  receive the OAuth token in the ``Authorization`` header field in the

  format described in `RFC 6750 <rfc6750_>`_ section 2.1. This aspect

  represents a significant difference from the usual OAuth flow.


  Dynamic Rendering of Your Specification

  ---------------------------------------


  Connexion uses Jinja2_ to allow specification parameterization through the ``arguments`` parameter. You can define specification arguments for the application either globally (via the ``connexion.App`` constructor) or for each specific API (via the ``connexion.App#add_api`` method):


  .. code-block:: python

      app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='swagger/',
                          arguments={'global': 'global_value'})
      app.add_api('my_api.yaml', arguments={'api_local': 'local_value'})
      app.run(port=8080)

  When a value is provided both globally and on the API, the API value will take precedence.


  Endpoint Routing to Your Python Views

  -------------------------------------


  Connexion uses the ``operationId`` from each `Operation Object`_ to

  identify which Python function should handle each URL.


  **Explicit Routing**:


  .. code-block:: yaml

      paths:
        /hello_world:
          post:
            operationId: myapp.api.hello_world

  If you provide this path in your specification POST requests to

  ``http://MYHOST/hello_world``, it will be handled by the function

  ``hello_world`` in the ``myapp.api`` module. Optionally, you can include

  ``x-swagger-router-controller`` (or ``x-openapi-router-controller``) in your

  operation definition, making ``operationId`` relative:


  .. code-block:: yaml

      paths:
        /hello_world:
          post:
            x-swagger-router-controller: myapp.api
            operationId: hello_world

  Keep in mind that Connexion follows how `HTTP methods work in Flask`_ and therefore HEAD requests will be handled by the ``operationId`` specified under GET in the specification. If both methods are supported, ``connexion.request.method`` can be used to determine which request was made.


  Automatic Routing

  -----------------


  To customize this behavior, Connexion can use alternative

  ``Resolvers``--for example, ``RestyResolver``. The ``RestyResolver``

  will compose an ``operationId`` based on the path and HTTP method of

  the endpoints in your specification:


  .. code-block:: python

      from connexion.resolver import RestyResolver

      app = connexion.App(__name__)
      app.add_api('swagger.yaml', resolver=RestyResolver('api'))

  .. code-block:: yaml

     paths:
       /:
         get:
            # Implied operationId: api.get
       /foo:
         get:
            # Implied operationId: api.foo.search
         post:
            # Implied operationId: api.foo.post

       '/foo/{id}':
         get:
            # Implied operationId: api.foo.get
         put:
            # Implied operationId: api.foo.put
         copy:
            # Implied operationId: api.foo.copy
         delete:
            # Implied operationId: api.foo.delete

  ``RestyResolver`` will give precedence to any ``operationId`` encountered in the specification. It will also respect

  ``x-router-controller``. You can import and extend ``connexion.resolver.Resolver`` to implement your own ``operationId``

  (and function) resolution algorithm.


  Automatic Parameter Handling

  ----------------------------


  Connexion automatically maps the parameters defined in your endpoint specification to arguments of your Python views as named parameters, and, whenever possible, with value casting. Simply define the endpoint's parameters with the same names as your views arguments.


  As an example, say you have an endpoint specified as:


  .. code-block:: yaml

      paths:
        /foo:
          get:
            operationId: api.foo_get
            parameters:
              - name: message
                description: Some message.
                in: query
                type: string
                required: true

  And the view function:


  .. code-block:: python

      # api.py file

      def foo_get(message):
          # do something
          return 'You send the message: {}'.format(message), 200

  In this example, Connexion automatically recognizes that your view

  function expects an argument named ``message`` and assigns the value

  of the endpoint parameter ``message`` to your view function.


  .. note:: In the OpenAPI 3.x.x spec, the requestBody does not have a name.
            By default it will be passed in as 'body'. You can optionally
            provide the x-body-name parameter in your requestBody
            (or legacy position within the requestBody schema)
            to override the name of the parameter that will be passed to your
            handler function.

  .. code-block:: yaml


      /path
        post:
          requestBody:
            x-body-name: body
            content:
              application/json:
                schema:
                  # legacy location here should be ignored because the preferred location for x-body-name is at the requestBody level above
                  x-body-name: this_should_be_ignored
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/someComponent'

  .. warning:: When you define a parameter at your endpoint as *not* required, and
      this argument does not have default value in your Python view, you will get
      a "missing positional argument" exception whenever you call this endpoint
      WITHOUT the parameter. Provide a default value for a named argument or use
      ``**kwargs`` dict.

  Type casting

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^


  Whenever possible, Connexion will try to parse your argument values and

  do type casting to related Python native values. The current

  available type castings are:


  +--------------+-------------+

  | OpenAPI Type | Python Type |

  +==============+=============+

  | integer      | int         |

  +--------------+-------------+

  | string       | str         |

  +--------------+-------------+

  | number       | float       |

  +--------------+-------------+

  | boolean      | bool        |

  +--------------+-------------+

  | array        | list        |

  +--------------+-------------+

  | null         | None        |

  +--------------+-------------+

  | object       | dict        |

  +--------------+-------------+


  If you use the ``array`` type In the Swagger definition, you can define the

  ``collectionFormat`` so that it won't be recognized. Connexion currently

  supports collection formats "pipes" and "csv". The default format is "csv".


  Connexion is opinionated about how the URI is parsed for ``array`` types.

  The default behavior for query parameters that have been defined multiple

  times is to use the right-most value. For example, if you provide a URI with

  the the query string ``?letters=a,b,c&letters=d,e,f``, connexion will set

  ``letters = ['d', 'e', 'f']``.


  You can override this behavior by specifying the URI parser in the app or

  api options.


  .. code-block:: python

     from connexion.decorators.uri_parsing import AlwaysMultiURIParser
     options = {'uri_parser_class': AlwaysMultiURIParser}
     app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='swagger/', options=options)

  You can implement your own URI parsing behavior by inheriting from

  ``connexion.decorators.uri_parsing.AbstractURIParser``.


  There are a handful of URI parsers included with connection.


  +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  | OpenAPIURIParser     | This parser adheres to the OpenAPI 3.x.x spec, and uses the ``style``     |

  | default: OpenAPI 3.0 | parameter. Query parameters are parsed from left to right, so if a query  |

  |                      | parameter is defined twice, then the right-most definition will take      |

  |                      | precedence. For example, if you provided a URI with the query string      |

  |                      | ``?letters=a,b,c&letters=d,e,f``, and ``style: simple``, then connexion   |

  |                      | will set ``letters = ['d', 'e', 'f']``. For additional information see    |

  |                      | `OpenAPI 3.0 Style Values`_.                                              |

  +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  | Swagger2URIParser    | This parser adheres to the Swagger 2.0 spec, and will only join together  |

  | default: OpenAPI 2.0 | multiple instance of the same query parameter if the ``collectionFormat`` |

  |                      | is set to ``multi``. Query parameters are parsed from left to right, so   |

  |                      | if a query parameter is defined twice, then the right-most definition     |

  |                      | wins. For example, if you provided a URI with the query string            |

  |                      | ``?letters=a,b,c&letters=d,e,f``, and ``collectionFormat: csv``, then     |

  |                      | connexion will set ``letters = ['d', 'e', 'f']``                          |

  +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  | FirstValueURIParser  | This parser behaves like the Swagger2URIParser, except that it prefers    |

  |                      | the first defined value. For example, if you provided a URI with the query|

  |                      | string ``?letters=a,b,c&letters=d,e,f`` and ``collectionFormat: csv``     |

  |                      | hen connexion will set ``letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']``                      |

  +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  | AlwaysMultiURIParser | This parser is backwards compatible with Connexion 1.x. It joins together |

  |                      | multiple instances of the same query parameter.                           |

  +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+



  Parameter validation

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


  Connexion can apply strict parameter validation for query and form data

  parameters.  When this is enabled, requests that include parameters not defined

  in the swagger spec return a 400 error.  You can enable it when adding the API

  to your application:


  .. code-block:: python

      app.add_api('my_apy.yaml', strict_validation=True)

  API Versioning and basePath

  ---------------------------


  Setting a base path is useful for versioned APIs. An example of

  a base path would be the ``1.0`` in ``http://MYHOST/1.0/hello_world``.


  If you are using OpenAPI 3.x.x, you set your base URL path in the

  servers block of the specification. You can either specify a full

  URL, or just a relative path.


  .. code-block:: yaml

      servers:
        - url: https://MYHOST/1.0
          description: full url example
        - url: /1.0
          description: relative path example

      paths:
        ...

  If you are using OpenAPI 2.0, you can define a ``basePath`` on the top level

  of your OpenAPI 2.0 specification.


  .. code-block:: yaml

      basePath: /1.0

      paths:
        ...

  If you don't want to include the base path in your specification, you

  can provide it when adding the API to your application:


  .. code-block:: python

      app.add_api('my_api.yaml', base_path='/1.0')

  Swagger JSON

  ------------

  Connexion makes the OpenAPI/Swagger specification in JSON format

  available from either ``swagger.json`` (for OpenAPI 2.0) or

  ``openapi.json`` (for OpenAPI 3.x.x) at the base path of the API.

  For example, if your base path was ``1.0``, then your spec would be

  available at ``/1.0/openapi.json``.


  You can disable serving the spec JSON at the application level:


  .. code-block:: python

      options = {"serve_spec": False}
      app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='openapi/',
                          options=options)
      app.add_api('my_api.yaml')

  You can also disable it at the API level:


  .. code-block:: python

      options = {"serve_spec": False}
      app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='openapi/')
      app.add_api('my_api.yaml', options=options)

  HTTPS Support

  -------------


  When specifying HTTPS as the scheme in the API YAML file, all the URIs

  in the served Swagger UI are HTTPS endpoints. The problem: The default

  server that runs is a "normal" HTTP server. This means that the

  Swagger UI cannot be used to play with the API. What is the correct

  way to start a HTTPS server when using Connexion?


  One way, `described by Flask`_, looks like this:


  .. code-block:: python

     from OpenSSL import SSL
     context = SSL.Context(SSL.SSLv23_METHOD)
     context.use_privatekey_file('yourserver.key')
     context.use_certificate_file('yourserver.crt')

     app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port='12344',
             debug=False/True, ssl_context=context)

  However, Connexion doesn't provide an ssl_context parameter. This is

  because Flask doesn't, either--but it uses ``**kwargs`` to send the

  parameters to the underlying `werkzeug`_ server.


  The Swagger UI Console

  ----------------------


  The Swagger UI for an API is available through pip extras.

  You can install it with ``pip install connexion[swagger-ui]``.

  It will be served up at ``{base_path}/ui/`` where ``base_path`` is the

  base path of the API.


  You can disable the Swagger UI at the application level:


  .. code-block:: python

      app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='openapi/',
                          options={"swagger_ui": False})
      app.add_api('my_api.yaml')


  You can also disable it at the API level:


  .. code-block:: python

      app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='openapi/')
      app.add_api('my_api.yaml', options={"swagger_ui": False})

  If necessary, you can explicitly specify the path to the directory with

  swagger-ui to not use the connexion[swagger-ui] distro.

  In order to do this, you should specify the following option:


  .. code-block:: python

     options = {'swagger_path': '/path/to/swagger_ui/'}
     app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='openapi/', options=options)

  If you wish to provide your own swagger-ui distro, note that connexion

  expects a jinja2 file called ``swagger_ui/index.j2`` in order to load the

  correct ``swagger.json`` by default. Your ``index.j2`` file can use the

  ``openapi_spec_url`` jinja variable for this purpose:


  .. code-block::

      const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({ url: "{{ openapi_spec_url }}"})

  Additionally, if you wish to use swagger-ui-3.x.x, it is also provided by

  installing connexion[swagger-ui], and can be enabled like this:


  .. code-block:: python

     from swagger_ui_bundle import swagger_ui_3_path
     options = {'swagger_path': swagger_ui_3_path}
     app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='swagger/', options=options)


  Server Backend

  --------------


  By default Connexion uses the Flask_ server. For asynchronous

  applications, you can also use Tornado_ as the HTTP server. To do

  this, set your server to ``tornado``:


  .. code-block:: python

      import connexion

      app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='swagger/')
      app.run(server='tornado', port=8080)

  You can use the Flask WSGI app with any WSGI container, e.g. `using

  Flask with uWSGI`_ (this is common):


  .. code-block:: python

      app = connexion.App(__name__, specification_dir='swagger/')
      application = app.app # expose global WSGI application object

  You can use the ``aiohttp`` framework as server backend as well:


  .. code-block:: python

      import connexion

      app = connexion.AioHttpApp(__name__, specification_dir='swagger/')
      app.run(port=8080)

  .. note:: Also check aiohttp handler examples_.


  Set up and run the installation code:


  .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo pip3 install uwsgi
      $ uwsgi --http :8080 -w app -p 16  # use 16 worker processes

  See the `uWSGI documentation`_ for more information.

  ![flasgger](docs/flasgger.png)


  Flasgger is a Flask extension to **extract [OpenAPI-Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operation-object)** from all Flask views registered in your API.


  Flasgger also comes with **[SwaggerUI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) embedded** so you can access [http://localhost:5000/apidocs](localhost:5000/apidocs) and visualize and interact with your API resources.


  Flasgger also **provides validation** of the incoming data, using the same specification it can validates if the data received as as a POST, PUT, PATCH is valid against the schema defined using **YAML**, **Python dictionaries** or **Marshmallow Schemas**.


  Flasgger can work with simple function views or MethodViews using docstring as specification, or using `@swag_from` decorator to get specification from **YAML** or **dict** and also provides **SwaggerView** which can use **Marshmallow Schemas**  as specification.


  Flasgger is compatible with `Flask-RESTful` so you can use `Resources` and `swag` specifications together, take a look at [restful example.](examples/restful.py)


  Flasgger also supports `Marshmallow APISpec` as base template for specification, if you are using APISPec from Marshmallow take a look at [apispec example.](examples/apispec_example.py)

  The examples and demo app can also be built and run as a Docker image/container:


  ```

  docker build -t flasgger .

  docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 --name flasgger flasgger

  ```

  Then access the Flasgger demo app at http://localhost:5000 .


  # Installation


  > under your virtualenv do:


  Ensure you have latest setuptools

  ```

  pip install -U setuptools

  ```


  then


  ```

  pip install flasgger

  ```


  or (dev version)


  ```

  pip install https://github.com/rochacbruno/flasgger/tarball/master

  ```


  > NOTE: If you want to use **Marshmallow Schemas** you also need to run `pip install marshmallow apispec`


  # Getting started


  ## Using docstrings as specification


  Create a file called for example `colors.py`


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flasgger import Swagger


  app = Flask(__name__)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  def colors(palette):
      """Example endpoint returning a list of colors by palette
      This is using docstrings for specifications.
      ---
      parameters:
        - name: palette
          in: path
          type: string
          enum: ['all', 'rgb', 'cmyk']
          required: true
          default: all
      definitions:
        Palette:
          type: object
          properties:
            palette_name:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/definitions/Color'
        Color:
          type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Palette'
          examples:
            rgb: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
      """
      all_colors = {
          'cmyk': ['cian', 'magenta', 'yellow', 'black'],
          'rgb': ['red', 'green', 'blue']
      }
      if palette == 'all':
          result = all_colors
      else:
          result = {palette: all_colors.get(palette)}

      return jsonify(result)

  app.run(debug=True)

  ```


  Now run:


  ```

  python colors.py

  ```


  And go to: [http://localhost:5000/apidocs/](http://localhost:5000/apidocs/)


  You should get:


  ![colors](docs/colors.png)


  ## Using external YAML files


  Save a new file `colors.yml`


  ```yaml

  Example endpoint returning a list of colors by palette

  In this example the specification is taken from external YAML file

  ---

  parameters:
    - name: palette
      in: path
      type: string
      enum: ['all', 'rgb', 'cmyk']
      required: true
      default: all
  definitions:
    Palette:
      type: object
      properties:
        palette_name:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Color'
    Color:
      type: string
  responses:
    200:
      description: A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)
      schema:
        $ref: '#/definitions/Palette'
      examples:
        rgb: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
  ```



  lets use the same example changing only the view function.


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from


  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  @swag_from('colors.yml')

  def colors(palette):
      ...
  ```


  If you do not want to use the decorator you can use the docstring `file:` shortcut.


  ```python

  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  def colors(palette):
      """
      file: colors.yml
      """
      ...
  ```



  ## Using dictionaries as raw specs


  Create a Python dictionary as:


  ```python

  specs_dict = {
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "palette",
        "in": "path",
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "all",
          "rgb",
          "cmyk"
        ],
        "required": "true",
        "default": "all"
      }
    ],
    "definitions": {
      "Palette": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "palette_name": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "$ref": "#/definitions/Color"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "Color": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "responses": {
      "200": {
        "description": "A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)",
        "schema": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/Palette"
        },
        "examples": {
          "rgb": [
            "red",
            "green",
            "blue"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }

  ```


  Now take the same function and use the dict in the place of YAML file.


  ```python

  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  @swag_from(specs_dict)

  def colors(palette):
      """Example endpoint returning a list of colors by palette
      In this example the specification is taken from specs_dict
      """
      ...
  ```


  ## Using Marshmallow Schemas


  > FIRST: `pip install marshmallow apispec`


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flasgger import Swagger, SwaggerView, Schema, fields



  class Color(Schema):
      name = fields.Str()

  class Palette(Schema):
      pallete_name = fields.Str()
      colors = fields.Nested(Color, many=True)

  class PaletteView(SwaggerView):
      parameters = [
          {
              "name": "palette",
              "in": "path",
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["all", "rgb", "cmyk"],
              "required": True,
              "default": "all"
          }
      ]
      responses = {
          200: {
              "description": "A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)",
              "schema": Palette
          }
      }

      def get(self, palette):
          """
          Colors API using schema
          This example is using marshmallow schemas
          """
          all_colors = {
              'cmyk': ['cian', 'magenta', 'yellow', 'black'],
              'rgb': ['red', 'green', 'blue']
          }
          if palette == 'all':
              result = all_colors
          else:
              result = {palette: all_colors.get(palette)}
          return jsonify(result)

  app = Flask(__name__)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  app.add_url_rule(
      '/colors/<palette>',
      view_func=PaletteView.as_view('colors'),
      methods=['GET']
  )


  app.run(debug=True)


  ```


  > NOTE: take a look at `examples/validation.py` for a more complete example.



  > NOTE: when catching arguments in path rule always use explicit types, bad: ``/api/<username>`` good: ``/api/<string:username>``



  ## Using **Flask RESTful** Resources


  Flasgger is compatible with Flask-RESTful you only need to install `pip install flask-restful` and then:


  ```python


  from flask import Flask

  from flasgger import Swagger

  from flask_restful import Api, Resource


  app = Flask(__name__)

  api = Api(app)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  class Username(Resource):
      def get(self, username):
         """
         This examples uses FlaskRESTful Resource
         It works also with swag_from, schemas and spec_dict
         ---
         parameters:
           - in: path
             name: username
             type: string
             required: true
         responses:
           200:
             description: A single user item
             schema:
               id: User
               properties:
                 username:
                   type: string
                   description: The name of the user
                   default: Steven Wilson
          """
          return {'username': username}, 200


  api.add_resource(Username, '/username/<username>')


  app.run(debug=True)


  ```


  ## Auto-parsing external YAML docs and `MethodView`s


  Flasgger can be configured to auto-parse external YAML API docs.  [Set a `doc_dir`](https://github.com/rochacbruno/flasgger/blob/aaef05c17cc559d01b7436211093463642eb6ae2/examples/parsed_view_func.py#L16) in your `app.config['SWAGGER']` and Swagger will load API docs by looking in `doc_dir` for YAML files stored by endpoint-name and method-name.  For example, `'doc_dir': './examples/docs/'` and a file `./examples/docs/items/get.yml` will provide a Swagger doc for `ItemsView` method `get`.


  Additionally, when using **Flask RESTful** per above, by passing `parse=True` when constructing `Swagger`, Flasgger will use  `flask_restful.reqparse.RequestParser`, locate all `MethodView`s and parsed and validated data will be stored in `flask.request.parsed_data`.


  ## Handling multiple http methods and routes for a single function


  You can separate specifications by endpoint or methods


  ```python

  from flasgger.utils import swag_from


  @app.route('/api/<string:username>', endpoint='with_user_name', methods=['PUT', 'GET'])

  @app.route('/api/', endpoint='without_user_name')

  @swag_from('path/to/external_file.yml', endpoint='with_user_name')

  @swag_from('path/to/external_file_no_user_get.yml', endpoint='without_user_name', methods=['GET'])

  @swag_from('path/to/external_file_no_user_put.yml', endpoint='without_user_name', methods=['PUT'])

  def fromfile_decorated(username=None):
      if not username:
          return "No user!"
      return jsonify({'username': username})
  ```


  And the same can be achieved with multiple methods in a `MethodView` or `SwaggerView` by

  registering the `url_rule` many times. Take a look at `examples/example_app`



  # Use the same data to validate your API POST body.


  Setting `swag_from`'s _validation_ parameter to `True` will validate incoming data automatically:


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from


  @swag_from('defs.yml', validation=True)

  def post():
      # if not validate returns ValidationError response with status 400
      # also returns the validation message.
  ```


  Using `swagger.validate` annotation is also possible:


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @swagger.validate('UserSchema')

  def post():
      '''
      file: defs.yml
      '''
      # if not validate returns ValidationError response with status 400
      # also returns the validation message.
  ```


  Yet you can call `validate` manually:


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from, validate


  @swag_from('defs.yml')

  def post():
      validate(request.json, 'UserSchema', 'defs.yml')
      # if not validate returns ValidationError response with status 400
      # also returns the validation message.
  ```


  It is also possible to define `validation=True` in `SwaggerView` and also use

  `specs_dict` for validation.


  Take a look at `examples/validation.py` for more information.


  All validation options can be found at http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html


  ### Custom validation


  By default Flasgger will use [python-jsonschema](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  to perform validation.


  Custom validation functions are supported as long as they meet the requirements:
   - take two, and only two, positional arguments:
      - the data to be validated as the first; and
      - the schema to validate against as the second argument
   - raise any kind of exception when validation fails.

  Any return value is discarded.



  Providing the function to the Swagger instance will make it the default:


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app, validation_function=my_validation_function)

  ```


  Providing the function as parameter of `swag_from` or `swagger.validate`

  annotations or directly to the `validate` function will force it's use

  over the default validation function for Swagger:


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from


  @swag_from('spec.yml', validation=True, validation_function=my_function)

  ...

  ```


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @swagger.validate('Pet', validation_function=my_function)

  ...

  ```


  ```python

  from flasgger import validate


  ...

      validate(
          request.json, 'Pet', 'defs.yml', validation_function=my_function)
  ```


  ### Validation Error handling


  By default Flasgger will handle validation errors by aborting the

  request with a 400 BAD REQUEST response with the error message.


  A custom validation error handling function can be provided to

  supersede default behavior as long as it meets the requirements:
   - take three, and only three, positional arguments:
      - the error raised as the first;
      - the data which failed validation as the second; and
      - the schema used in to validate as the third argument


  Providing the function to the Swagger instance will make it the default:


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app, validation_error_handler=my_handler)

  ```


  Providing the function as parameter of `swag_from` or `swagger.validate`

  annotations or directly to the `validate` function will force it's use

  over the default validation function for Swagger:


  ```python

  from flasgger import swag_from


  @swag_from(
      'spec.yml', validation=True, validation_error_handler=my_handler)
  ...

  ```


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger


  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @swagger.validate('Pet', validation_error_handler=my_handler)

  ...

  ```


  ```python

  from flasgger import validate


  ...

      validate(
          request.json, 'Pet', 'defs.yml',
          validation_error_handler=my_handler)
  ```


  Examples of use of a custom validation error handler function can be

  found at [example validation_error_handler.py](examples/validation_error_handler.py)


  # Get defined schemas as python dictionaries


  You may wish to use schemas you defined in your Swagger specs as dictionaries

  without replicating the specification. For that you can use the `get_schema`

  method:


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flasgger import Swagger, swag_from


  app = Flask(__name__)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @swagger.validate('Product')

  def post():
      """
      post endpoint
      ---
      tags:
        - products
      parameters:
        - name: body
          in: body
          required: true
          schema:
            id: Product
            required:
              - name
            properties:
              name:
                type: string
                description: The product's name.
                default: "Guarana"
      responses:
        200:
          description: The product inserted in the database
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Product'
      """
      rv = db.insert(request.json)
      return jsonify(rv)

  ...


  product_schema = swagger.get_schema('product')

  ```


  This method returns a dictionary which contains the Flasgger schema id,

  all defined parameters and a list of required parameters.


  # HTML sanitizer


  By default Flasgger will try to sanitize the content in YAML definitions

  replacing every ```\n``` with ```<br>``` but you can change this behaviour

  setting another kind of sanitizer.


  ```python

  from flasgger import Swagger, NO_SANITIZER


  app =Flask()

  swagger = Swagger(app, sanitizer=NO_SANITIZER)

  ```


  You can write your own sanitizer


  ```python

  swagger = Swagger(app, sanitizer=lambda text: do_anything_with(text))

  ```


  There is also a Markdown parser available, if you want to be able to render

  Markdown in your specs description use **MK_SANITIZER**



  # Swagger UI and templates


  You can override the `templates/flasgger/index.html` in your application and

  this template will be the `index.html` for SwaggerUI. Use `flasgger/ui2/templates/index.html`

  as base for your customization.


  Flasgger supports Swagger UI versions 2 and 3, The version 3 is still experimental but you

  can try setting `app.config['SWAGGER']['uiversion']`.


  ```python

  app = Flask(__name__)

  app.config['SWAGGER'] = {
      'title': 'My API',
      'uiversion': 3
  }

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  ```


  # OpenAPI 3.0 Support


  There is experimental support for OpenAPI 3.0 that should work when using SwaggerUI 3. To use OpenAPI 3.0, set `app.config['SWAGGER']['openapi']` to a version that the current SwaggerUI 3 supports such as `'3.0.2'`.


  For an example of this that uses `callbacks` and `requestBody`, see the [callbacks example](examples/callbacks.py).


  ## Externally loading Swagger UI and jQuery JS/CSS


  Starting with Flasgger 0.9.2 you can specify external URL locations for loading the JavaScript and CSS for the Swagger and jQuery libraries loaded in the Flasgger default templates.  If the configuration properties below are omitted, Flasgger will serve static versions it includes - these versions may be older than the current Swagger UI v2 or v3 releases.


  The following example loads Swagger UI and jQuery versions from unpkg.com:


  ```

  swagger_config = Swagger.DEFAULT_CONFIG

  swagger_config['swagger_ui_bundle_js'] = '//unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@3/swagger-ui-bundle.js'

  swagger_config['swagger_ui_standalone_preset_js'] = '//unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@3/swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js'

  swagger_config['jquery_js'] = '//unpkg.com/jquery@2.2.4/dist/jquery.min.js'

  swagger_config['swagger_ui_css'] = '//unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@3/swagger-ui.css'

  Swagger(app, config=swagger_config)

  ```


  # Initializing Flasgger with default data.


  You can start your Swagger spec with any default data providing a template:


  ```python

  template = {
    "swagger": "2.0",
    "info": {
      "title": "My API",
      "description": "API for my data",
      "contact": {
        "responsibleOrganization": "ME",
        "responsibleDeveloper": "Me",
        "email": "me@me.com",
        "url": "www.me.com",
      },
      "termsOfService": "http://me.com/terms",
      "version": "0.0.1"
    },
    "host": "mysite.com",  # overrides localhost:500
    "basePath": "/api",  # base bash for blueprint registration
    "schemes": [
      "http",
      "https"
    ],
    "operationId": "getmyData"
  }


  swagger = Swagger(app, template=template)


  ```


  And then the template is the default data unless some view changes it. You

  can also provide all your specs as template and have no views. Or views in

  external APP.


  ## Getting default data at runtime


  Sometimes you need to get some data at runtime depending on dynamic values ex: you want to check `request.is_secure` to decide if `schemes` will be `https` you can do that by using `LazyString`.


  ```py

  from flask import Flask

  from flasgger import, Swagger, LazyString, LazyJSONEncoder


  app = Flask(__init__)


  # Set the custom Encoder (Inherit it if you need to customize)

  app.json_encoder = LazyJSONEncoder



  template = dict(
      info={
          'title': LazyString(lambda: 'Lazy Title'),
          'version': LazyString(lambda: '99.9.9'),
          'description': LazyString(lambda: 'Hello Lazy World'),
          'termsOfService': LazyString(lambda: '/there_is_no_tos')
      },
      host=LazyString(lambda: request.host),
      schemes=[LazyString(lambda: 'https' if request.is_secure else 'http')],
      foo=LazyString(lambda: "Bar")
  )

  Swagger(app, template=template)


  ```


  The `LazyString` values will be evaluated only when `jsonify` encodes the value at runtime, so you have access to Flask `request, session, g, etc..` and also may want to access a database.


  ## Behind a reverse proxy


  Sometimes you're serving your swagger docs behind an reverse proxy (e.g. NGINX).  When following the [Flask guidance](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/35/),

  the swagger docs will load correctly, but the "Try it Out" button points to the wrong place.  This can be fixed with the following code:


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, request

  from flasgger import Swagger, LazyString, LazyJSONEncoder


  app = Flask(__name__)

  app.json_encoder = LazyJSONEncoder


  template = dict(swaggerUiPrefix=LazyString(lambda : request.environ.get('HTTP_X_SCRIPT_NAME', '')))

  swagger = Swagger(app, template=template)


  ``` 


  # Customize default configurations


  Custom configurations such as a different specs route or disabling Swagger UI can be provided to Flasgger:


  ```python

  swagger_config = {
      "headers": [
      ],
      "specs": [
          {
              "endpoint": 'apispec_1',
              "route": '/apispec_1.json',
              "rule_filter": lambda rule: True,  # all in
              "model_filter": lambda tag: True,  # all in
          }
      ],
      "static_url_path": "/flasgger_static",
      # "static_folder": "static",  # must be set by user
      "swagger_ui": True,
      "specs_route": "/apidocs/"
  }


  swagger = Swagger(app, config=swagger_config)


  ```


  ## Extracting Definitions


  Definitions can be extracted when `id` is found in spec, example:


  ```python

  from flask import Flask, jsonify

  from flasgger import Swagger


  app = Flask(__name__)

  swagger = Swagger(app)


  @app.route('/colors/<palette>/')

  def colors(palette):
      """Example endpoint returning a list of colors by palette
      ---
      parameters:
        - name: palette
          in: path
          type: string
          enum: ['all', 'rgb', 'cmyk']
          required: true
          default: all
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of colors (may be filtered by palette)
          schema:
            id: Palette
            type: object
            properties:
              palette_name:
                type: array
                items:
                  schema:
                    id: Color
                    type: string
          examples:
            rgb: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
      """
      all_colors = {
          'cmyk': ['cian', 'magenta', 'yellow', 'black'],
          'rgb': ['red', 'green', 'blue']
      }
      if palette == 'all':
          result = all_colors
      else:
          result = {palette: all_colors.get(palette)}

      return jsonify(result)

  app.run(debug=True)

  ```


  In this example you do not have to pass `definitions` but need to add `id` to

  your schemas.

  Prance provides parsers for `Swagger/OpenAPI

  2.0 and 3.0 <http://swagger.io/specification/>`__ API specifications in Python.

  It uses `openapi\_spec\_validator <https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-spec-validator>`__,

  `swagger\_spec\_validator <https://github.com/Yelp/swagger_spec_validator>`__ or

  `flex <https://github.com/pipermerriam/flex>`__

  to validate specifications, but additionally resolves `JSON

  references <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03>`__

  in accordance with the OpenAPI spec.


  Mostly the latter involves handling non-URI references; OpenAPI is fine

  with providing relative file paths, whereas JSON references require URIs

  at this point in time.


  Prance is `up for adoption <https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance/issues/91>`__.


  Usage

  =====


  Installation

  ------------


  Prance is available from PyPI, and can be installed via pip:


  .. code:: bash

      $ pip install prance

  Note that this will install the code, but additional subpackages must be specified

  to unlock various pieces of functionality. At minimum, a parsing backend must be

  installed. For the CLI functionality, you need further dependencies.


  The recommended installation installs the CLI, uses ICU and installs one validation

  backend:


  .. code:: bash

      $ pip install prance[osv,icu,cli]

  Make sure you have `ICU Unicode Library <http://site.icu-project.org/home>`__ installed,

  as well as Python dev library before running the commands above. If not, use the

  following commands:


  **Ubuntu**


  .. code:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install libicu-dev
      $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev


  Command Line Interface

  ----------------------


  After installing prance, a CLI is available for validating (and resolving

  external references in) specs:


  .. code:: bash

      # Validates with resolving
      $ prance validate path/to/swagger.yml

      # Validates without resolving
      $ prance validate --no-resolve path/to/swagger.yml

      # Fetch URL, validate and resolve.
      $ prance validate http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json
      Processing "http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json"...
       -> Resolving external references.
      Validates OK as Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0!

  Validation is not the only feature of prance. One of the side effects of

  resolving is that from a spec with references, one can create a fully resolved

  output spec. In the past, this was done via options to the ``validate`` command,

  but now there's a specific command just for this purpose:


  .. code:: bash

      # Compile spec
      $ prance compile path/to/input.yml path/to/output.yml


  Lastly, with the arrival of OpenAPI 3.0.0, it becomes useful for tooling to

  convert older specs to the new standard. Instead of re-inventing the wheel,

  prance just provides a CLI command for passing specs to the web API of

  `swagger2openapi <https://github.com/Mermade/swagger2openapi>`__ - a working

  internet connection is therefore required for this command:


  .. code:: bash

      # Convert spec
      $ prance convert path/to/swagger.yml path/to/openapi.yml


  Code

  ----


  Most likely you have spec file and want to parse it:


  .. code:: python

      from prance import ResolvingParser
      parser = ResolvingParser('path/to/my/swagger.yaml')
      parser.specification  # contains fully resolved specs as a dict

  Prance also includes a non-resolving parser that does not follow JSON

  references, in case you prefer that.


  .. code:: python

      from prance import BaseParser
      parser = BaseParser('path/to/my/swagger.yaml')
      parser.specification  # contains specs as a dict still containing JSON references

  On Windows, the code reacts correctly if you pass posix-like paths

  (``/c:/swagger``) or if the path is relative.  If you pass absolute

  windows path (like ``c:\swagger.yaml``), you can use

  ``prance.util.fs.abspath`` to convert them.


  URLs can also be parsed:


  .. code:: python

      parser = ResolvingParser('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json')

  Largely, that's it. There is a whole slew of utility code that you may

  or may not find useful, too. Look at the `full documentation

  <https://jfinkhaeuser.github.io/prance/#api-modules>`__ for details.



  Compatibility

  -------------


  *Python Versions*


  Version 0.16.2 is the last version supporting Python 2. It was released on

  Nov 12th, 2019. Python 2 reaches end of life at the end of 2019. If you wish

  for updates to the Python 2 supported packages, please contact the maintainer

  directly.


  Until fairly recently, we also tested with `PyPy <https://www.pypy.org/>`__.

  Unfortunately, Travis isn't very good at supporting this. So in the absence

  of spare time, they're disabled. `Issue 50 <https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance/issues/50>`__

  tracks progress on that.


  Similarly, but less critically, Python 3.4 is no longer receiving a lot of

  love from CI vendors, so automated builds on that version are no longer

  supported.


  *Backends*


  Different validation backends support different features.


  +------------------------+----------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  | Backend                | Python Version | OpenAPI Version | Strict Mode | Notes                                                 | Available From | Link                                                                              |

  +========================+================+=================+=============+=======================================================+================+===================================================================================+

  | swagger-spec-validator | 2 and 3        | 2.0 only        | yes         | Slow; does not accept integer keys (see strict mode). | prance 0.1     | `swagger\_spec\_validator <https://github.com/Yelp/swagger_spec_validator>`__     |

  +------------------------+----------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  | flex                   | 2 and 3        | 2.0 only        | n/a         | Fastest; unfortunately deprecated.                    | prance 0.8     | `flex <https://github.com/pipermerriam/flex>`__                                   |

  +------------------------+----------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  | openapi-spec-validator | 2 and 3        | 2.0 and 3.0     | yes         | Slow; does not accept integer keys (see strict mode). | prance 0.11    | `openapi\_spec\_validator <https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-spec-validator>`__    |

  +------------------------+----------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


  You can select the backend in the constructor of the parser(s):


  .. code:: python

      parser = ResolvingParser('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json', backend = 'openapi-spec-validator')


  No backend is included in the dependencies; they are detected at run-time. If you install them,

  they can be used:


  .. code:: bash

      $ pip install openapi-spec-validator
      $ pip install prance
      $ prance validate --backend=openapi-spec-validator path/to/spec.yml

  *A note on flex usage:* While flex is the fastest validation backend, unfortunately it is no longer

  maintained and there are issues with its dependencies. For one thing, it depends on a version of `PyYAML`

  that contains security flaws. For another, it depends explicitly on older versions of `click`.


  If you use the flex subpackage, therefore, you do so at your own risk.


  *Compatibility*


  See `COMPATIBILITY.rst <https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.rst>`__

  for a list of known issues.



  Partial Reference Resolution

  ----------------------------


  It's possible to instruct the parser to only resolve some kinds of references.

  This allows e.g. resolving references from external URLs, whilst keeping local

  references (i.e. to local files, or file internal) intact.


  .. code:: python

      from prance import ResolvingParser
      from prance.util.resolver import RESOLVE_HTTP

      parser = ResolvingParser('/path/to/spec', resolve_types = RESOLVE_HTTP)


  Multiple types can be specified by OR-ing constants together:


  .. code:: python

      from prance import ResolvingParser
      from prance.util.resolver import RESOLVE_HTTP, RESOLVE_FILES

      parser = ResolvingParser('/path/to/spec', resolve_types = RESOLVE_HTTP | RESOLVE_FILES)


  Extensions

  ----------


  Prance includes the ability to reference outside swagger definitions

  in outside Python packages. Such a package must already be importable

  (i.e. installed), and be accessible via the

  `ResourceManager API <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#resourcemanager-api>`__

  (some more info `here <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#including-data-files>`__).


  For example, you might create a package ``common_swag`` with the file

  ``base.yaml`` containing the definition


  .. code:: yaml

      definitions:
        Severity:
          type: string
          enum:
          - INFO
          - WARN
          - ERROR
          - FATAL

  In the ``setup.py`` for ``common_swag`` you would add lines such as


  .. code:: python

      packages=find_packages('src'),
      package_dir={'': 'src'},
      package_data={
          '': '*.yaml'
      }

  Then, having installed ``common_swag`` into some application, you could

  now write


  .. code:: yaml

      definitions:
        Message:
          type: object
          properties:
            severity:
              $ref: 'python://common_swag/base.yaml#/definitions/Severity'
            code:
              type: string
            summary:
              type: string
            description:
              type: string
          required:
          - severity
          - summary

  # route-swagger


  [![Build status](https://circleci.com/gh/frankiesardo/route-swagger.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/frankiesardo/route-swagger)


  Generate Swagger documentation from pedestal (or tripod) routes


  - [Demo](https://pedestal-swagger.herokuapp.com)


  ## For old pedestal-swagger users


  This project now focuses solely on route transformation and schema validation and thus is pedestal-agnostic.


  Route-swagger is a much lower level library. Everything the old pedestal-swagger did is still possible (look at the example repo) but requires a bit more boilerplate. The major breaking difference is that now route-swagger uses ring specific keys for describing the schema rather than swagger ones, e.g.


  ```clj

  {:parameters {:body-params ..
                :form-params ..
                :query-params ..
                :path-params ..
                :headers ..}
    :responses {500 {:body .. :headers ..}}}            
  ```


  Instead of `body`, `formData`, `query`, `schema`, etc. That should make it much more user friendly for clojure users.

  The grpc-gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler

  [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

  It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which

  'translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the

  [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)

  annotations in your service definitions.


  This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.


  ![architecture introduction diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12hp4CPqrNPFhattL_cIoJptFvlAqm5wLQ0ggqI5mkCg/pub?w=749&amp;h=370)


  ## Check out our [documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/)!


  ## Background

  gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming

  languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is

  combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional

  RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining

  backwards-compatibility, supporting languages or clients not well supported by

  gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful

  JSON architecture.


  This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.

  A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all

  that's needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.


  ## Installation


  The grpc-gateway requires a local installation of the Google protocol buffers

  compiler `protoc` v3.0.0 or above. Please install this via your local package

  manager or by downloading one of the releases from the official repository:


  https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases


  The following instructions assume you are using

  [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for dependency

  management. Use a

  [tool dependency](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)

  to track the versions of the following executable packages:


  ```go

  // +build tools


  package tools


  import (
      _ "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway"
      _ "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-swagger"
      _ "github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go"
  )

  ```


  Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running


  ```sh

  $ go install \
      github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
      github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-swagger \
      github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
  ```


  This will place three binaries in your `$GOBIN`;


  * `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

  * `protoc-gen-swagger`

  * `protoc-gen-go`


  Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.


  ## Usage


  1. Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers 

     `your_service.proto`:
     ```protobuf
     syntax = "proto3";
     package example;
     message StringMessage {
       string value = 1;
     }

     service YourService {
       rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
     }
     ```

  2. Add a [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)

  annotation to your .proto file

     `your_service.proto`:
     ```diff
      syntax = "proto3";
      package example;
     +
     +import "google/api/annotations.proto";
     +
      message StringMessage {
        string value = 1;
      }

      service YourService {
     -  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
     +  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
     +    option (google.api.http) = {
     +      post: "/v1/example/echo"
     +      body: "*"
     +    };
     +  }
      }
     ```

     See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
     for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
     and generated Swagger output.

     If you do not want to modify the proto file for use with grpc-gateway you can
     alternatively use an external
     [gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
     [Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/grpcapiconfiguration.html)
     for more information.

  3. Generate gRPC stub

     The following generates gRPC code for Golang based on `path/to/your_service.proto`:
     ```sh
     protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
       -I$GOPATH/src \
       -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
       --go_out=plugins=grpc:. \
       path/to/your_service.proto
     ```

     It will generate a stub file `path/to/your_service.pb.go`.

  4. Implement your service in gRPC as usual

     1. (Optional) Generate gRPC stub in the [other programming languages](https://grpc.io/docs/).

       For example, the following generates gRPC code for Ruby based on `path/to/your_service.proto`:
       ```sh
       protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
         -I$GOPATH/src \
         -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
         --ruby_out=. \
         path/to/your_service.proto

       protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
         -I$GOPATH/src \
         -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
         --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=grpc_ruby_plugin \
         --grpc-ruby_out=. \
         path/to/your_service.proto
       ```
     2. Add the googleapis-common-protos gem (or your language equivalent) as a dependency to your project.
     3. Implement your gRPC service stubs

  5. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

     ```sh
     protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
       -I$GOPATH/src \
       -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
       --grpc-gateway_out=logtostderr=true:. \
       path/to/your_service.proto
     ```

     It will generate a reverse proxy `path/to/your_service.pb.gw.go`.

  6. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

     ```go
     package main
   
     import (
       "context"  // Use "golang.org/x/net/context" for Golang version <= 1.6
       "flag"
       "net/http"
   
       "github.com/golang/glog"
       "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/runtime"
       "google.golang.org/grpc"
   
       gw "path/to/your_service_package"  // Update
     )
   
     var (
       // command-line options:
       // gRPC server endpoint
       grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String("grpc-server-endpoint",  "localhost:9090", "gRPC server endpoint")
     )
   
     func run() error {
       ctx := context.Background()
       ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
       defer cancel()
   
       // Register gRPC server endpoint
       // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
       mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
       opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithInsecure()}
       err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
       if err != nil {
         return err
       }
   
       // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
       return http.ListenAndServe(":8081", mux)
     }
   
     func main() {
       flag.Parse()
       defer glog.Flush()
   
       if err := run(); err != nil {
         glog.Fatal(err)
       }
     }
     ```

  7. (Optional) Generate swagger definitions using `protoc-gen-swagger`

     ```sh
     protoc -I/usr/local/include -I. \
       -I$GOPATH/src \
       -I$GOPATH/src/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis \
       --swagger_out=logtostderr=true:. \
       path/to/your_service.proto
     ```

  ## Video intro


  This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer

  [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro to

  using the grpc-gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base:

  https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.


  [![gRPC-Gateway presentation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk)


  ## Parameters and flags


  During code generation with `protoc`, flags to grpc-gateway tools must be passed

  through protoc using the `--<tool_suffix>_out=<flags>:<path>` pattern, for

  example:


  ```sh

  --grpc-gateway_out=logtostderr=true,repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.

  --swagger_out=logtostderr=true,repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.

  ```


  `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway` supports custom mapping from Protobuf `import` to

  Golang import paths. They are compatible to

  [the parameters with same names in `protoc-gen-go`](https://github.com/golang/protobuf#parameters)

  (except `source_relative`).


  In addition we also support the `request_context` parameter in order to use the

  `http.Request`'s Context (only for Go 1.7 and above). This parameter can be

  useful to pass request scoped context between the gateway and the gRPC service.


  `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway` also supports some more command line flags to control

  logging. You can give these flags together with parameters above. Run

  `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway --help` for more details about the flags.


  Similarly, `protoc-gen-swagger` supports command-line flags to control Swagger

  output (for example, `json_names_for_fields` to output JSON names for fields

  instead of protobuf names). Run `protoc-gen-swagger --help` for more flag

  details. Further Swagger customization is possible by annotating your `.proto`

  files with options from

  [openapiv2.proto](protoc-gen-swagger/options/openapiv2.proto) - see

  [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)

  for examples.


  ## More Examples

  More examples are available under `examples` directory.

  * `proto/examplepb/echo_service.proto`, `proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto`, `proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.proto`: service definition
    * `proto/examplepb/echo_service.pb.go`, `proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.pb.go`, `proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.pb.go`: [generated] stub of the service
    * `proto/examplepb/echo_service.pb.gw.go`, `proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.pb.gw.go`, `proto/examplepb/uannotated_echo_service.pb.gw.go`: [generated] reverse proxy for the service
    * `proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.yaml`: gRPC API Configuration for ```unannotated_echo_service.proto```
  * `server/main.go`: service implementation

  * `main.go`: entrypoint of the generated reverse proxy


  To use the same port for custom HTTP handlers (e.g. serving `swagger.json`),

  gRPC-gateway, and a gRPC server, see

  [this example by CoreOS](https://github.com/philips/grpc-gateway-example/blob/master/cmd/serve.go)

  (and its accompanying [blog post](https://coreos.com/blog/grpc-protobufs-swagger.html)).


  ## Features


  ### Supported


  * Generating JSON API handlers.

  * Method parameters in request body.

  * Method parameters in request path.

  * Method parameters in query string.

  * Enum fields in path parameter (including repeated enum fields).

  * Mapping streaming APIs to newline-delimited JSON streams.

  * Mapping HTTP headers with `Grpc-Metadata-` prefix to gRPC metadata (prefixed with `grpcgateway-`)

  * Optionally emitting API definitions for

  [OpenAPI (Swagger) v2](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/).

  * Setting [gRPC timeouts](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#requests)

  through inbound HTTP `Grpc-Timeout` header.

  * Partial support for [gRPC API Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config)

  files as an alternative to annotation.

  * Automatically translating PATCH requests into Field Mask gRPC requests. See

  [the docs](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/patch.html)

  for more information.


  ### No plan to support

  But patch is welcome.

  * Method parameters in HTTP headers.

  * Handling trailer metadata.

  * Encoding request/response body in XML.

  * True bi-directional streaming.


  # Mapping gRPC to HTTP


  * [How gRPC error codes map to HTTP status codes in the response](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/blob/master/runtime/errors.go#L15).

  * HTTP request source IP is added as `X-Forwarded-For` gRPC request header.

  * HTTP request host is added as `X-Forwarded-Host` gRPC request header.

  * HTTP `Authorization` header is added as `authorization` gRPC request header.

  * Remaining Permanent HTTP header keys (as specified by the IANA

  [here](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml)

  are prefixed with `grpcgateway-` and added with their values to gRPC request

  header.

  * HTTP headers that start with 'Grpc-Metadata-' are mapped to gRPC metadata

  (prefixed with `grpcgateway-`).

  * While configurable, the default {un,}marshaling uses

  [jsonpb](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb) with

  `OrigName: true`.

  Features

  --------------------------

  - **Supports Swagger 2.0 specs in JSON or YAML** <br>

  Swagger Express Middleware uses [Swagger-Parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-parser) to parse, validate, and dereference Swagger files.  You can even split your spec into multiple different files using `$ref` pointers.


  - **Thoroughly tested**<br>

  Over 1,000 unit tests and integration tests with 100% code coverage.  Tested on [**over 1,000 real-world APIs**](https://apis.guru/browse-apis/) from Google, Instagram, Spotify, etc.  All tests are run on Mac, Linux, and Windows using all LTS versions of Node.


  - [**Mock middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/mock.html)<br>

  **Fully-functional mock** implementations for every operation in your API, including data persistence, all with **zero code!**  This is a great way to test-drive your API as you write it, or for quick demos and POCs.  You can even extend the mock middleware with your own logic and data to fill in any gaps.


  - [**Metadata middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/metadata.html)<br>

  Annotates each request with all the relevant information from the Swagger definition.  The path, the operation, the parameters, the security requirements - they're all easily accessible at `req.swagger`.


  - [**Parse Request middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/parseRequest.html)<br>

  Parses incoming requests and converts everything into the correct data types, according to your Swagger API definition.


  - [**Validate Request middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/validateRequest.html)<br>

  Ensures that every request complies with your Swagger API definition, or returns the appropriate HTTP error codes if needed.  Of course, you can catch any validation errors and handle them however you want.


  - [**CORS middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/CORS.html)<br>

  Adds the appropriate CORS headers to each request and automatically responds to CORS preflight requests, all in compliance with your Swagger API definition.


  - [**Files middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/files.html)<br>

  Serves the Swagger API file(s) in JSON or YAML format so they can be used with front-end tools like [Swagger UI](http://www.swagger.io), [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io), and [Postman](http://getpostman.com).




  Installation and Use

  --------------------------

  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).


  ```bash

  npm install @apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware

  ```

  Then use it in your [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) script like this:


  ```javascript

  const express = require('express');

  const createMiddleware = require('@apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware');


  let app = express();


  createMiddleware('PetStore.yaml', app, function(err, middleware) {
      // Add all the Swagger Express Middleware, or just the ones you need.
      // NOTE: Some of these accept optional options (omitted here for brevity)
      app.use(
          middleware.metadata(),
          middleware.CORS(),
          middleware.files(),
          middleware.parseRequest(),
          middleware.validateRequest(),
          middleware.mock()
      );

      app.listen(8000, function() {
          console.log('The PetStore sample is now running at http://localhost:8000');
      });
  });

  ```




  Samples & Walkthroughs

  --------------------------

  Swagger Express Middleware comes two samples that use the [Swagger Pet Store API](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/samples/PetStore.yaml).


  #### Sample 1

  This sample demonstrates the most simplistic usage of Swagger Express Middleware. It simply creates a new Express Application and adds all of the Swagger middleware without changing any options, and without adding any custom middleware.


  * [Source Code](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/samples/sample1.js)

  * [Walkthrough](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/walkthroughs/running.html)



  #### Sample 2

  This sample demonstrates a few more advanced features of Swagger Express Middleware, such as setting a few options, initializing the mock data store, and adding custom middleware logic.


  * [Source Code](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/samples/sample2.js)

  ## Development


  _Note:  One of the goals of this monorepo is to support independent package versions.  The author has used other popular options out there (like lerna), and has found independent versioning to behave strangely with them.  Another goal with the current approach is to reduce boilerplate code as much as possible (something tools like lerna don't help with).  The inspiration for the current approach came from [boennemann/alle](https://github.com/boennemann/alle).  The author isn't

  married to the current approach, so if you have ideas on how to simplify the development of this monorepo by all means please [open an issue](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api/issues/new)._


  ### Typical Workflow for Contributors


  Let's say you're working on a package under [./packages](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api/tree/master/packages).  Here's what you do:


  1. `cd open-api`

  1. `./bin/test packages/<package_you're_working_on>`

  1. Make your changes.
    1. _Do not bump the version in package.json._  A maintainer will handle that once your PR is merged.
  1. Once you're satisfied with your changes:
    1. Create a new branch `git checkout -b my-branch` (in case you haven't done so already).
    1. `./bin/commit packages/<package_you're_working_on> 'commit message describing your change.  can be multi line here.  just close with a single quote like so:'`
    1. Push your change to your fork
    1. Open a PR.

  ### bin


  Several scripts have been created to aid in the development of this monorepo (see [./bin](./bin)).  They assume that your `$PWD` is the root of the repository.  Here is a brief summary of common actions:


  * Testing
    * (Note: `./bin/test` will run `npm i` in the package _prior_ to running the tests)
    * Test a single package - `./bin/test packages/<package_to_test>` (starts the test in watch mode)
    * Test all packages - `./bin/test`
  * Commit changes to a package - `./bin/commit packages/<package_to_commit> 'Commit message'` (the commit message will be prepended with the package name e.g. `<package_to_commit>: Commit message`


  #### dev-tools

  Scripts in this directory wrap common tools, like `nyc`, `tsc`, and `mocha`.  They reduce boilerplate and are called from npm scripts.

  # cowboy-swagger

  [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) integration for [Cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy) (built on [trails](https://github.com/inaka/cowboy-trails)).


  ## Contact Us

  If you find any **bugs** or have a **problem** while using this library, please

  [open an issue](https://github.com/inaka/elvis/issues/new) in this repo

  (or a pull request :)).


  ## Requirements

  Cowboy Swagger requires Erlang 18+ after 0.1.0 version


  ## Why Cowboy Swagger?

  Simple, because there isn't a tool in Erlang to document Cowboy RESTful APIs easy and fast,

  and to improve development productivity.


  With `cowboy_swagger` is possible to integrate Swagger to your Erlang projects that use Cowboy as a web server.

  It is extremely easy to use, and with just a few steps you'll have a nice Web documentation for your RESTful APIs.


  To learn a bit more about Swagger, please check this [blog post](http://inaka.net/blog/2015/06/23/erlang-swagger-2015/).


  ## How to Use it?

  This is the best part. It is extremely easy.


  ### 1. Document each Cowboy Handler

  Because `cowboy_swagger` runs on top of `trails`, the first thing that you have to do

  is document all about your handler within the trails metadata. Keep in mind that

  all fields defined within each method into the metadata must be compliant with the

  [Swagger specification](http://swagger.io/specification).


  For example, suppose that you have `example_echo_handler`, so it must implement the `trails/0`

  callback from `trails_handler` behaviour:


  ```erlang

  trails() ->
    Metadata =
      #{get =>
        #{tags => ["echo"],
          description => "Gets echo var from the server",
          produces => ["text/plain"]
        },
        put =>
        #{tags => ["echo"],
          description => "Sets echo var in the server",
          produces => ["text/plain"],
          parameters => [
            #{name => <<"echo">>,
              description => <<"Echo message">>,
              in => <<"path">>,
              required => false,
              type => <<"string">>}
          ]
        }
      },
    [trails:trail("/message/[:echo]", example_echo_handler, [], Metadata)].
  ```


  To get a better idea of how your handler should look like, please check [here](./example/src/example_echo_handler.erl).


  ### 2. Include cowboy_swagger in your app

  First, you need to include `cowboy_swagger_handler` module in your list of trails to be compiled.


  ```erlang

  % Include cowboy_swagger_handler in the trails list

  Trails = trails:trails([example_echo_handler,
                          example_description_handler,
                          cowboy_swagger_handler]),
  % store them

  trails:store(Trails),

  % and then compile them

  Dispatch = trails:single_host_compile(Trails),

  ```


  The snippet of code above is usually placed when you start `cowboy`. Check it [here](./example/src/example.erl#L31).


  Then add `cowboy_swagger` to the list of apps to be loaded in your `*.app.src` file.


  ```erlang

  {application, example,
   [
    {description, "Cowboy Swagger Basic Example."},
    {vsn, "0.1"},
    {applications,
     [kernel,
      stdlib,
      jsx,
      cowboy,
      trails,
      cowboy_swagger
     ]},
    {modules, []},
    {mod, {example, []}},
    {registered, []},
    {start_phases, [{start_trails_http, []}]}
   ]
  }.

  ```


  And that's it, you got it. Now start your application and then you will have access to the API docs

  under the path `/api-docs`. Supposing that you're running the app on `localhost:8080`,

  that will be [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs).


  ## Configuration


  Additionally, `cowboy_swagger` can be configured/customized from a `*.config` file:


  ### app.config


  ```erlang

  [
   %% Other apps ...

   %% cowboy_swagger config
   {cowboy_swagger,
    [
     %% `static_files`: Static content directory. This is where Swagger-UI
     %% is located. Default: `priv/swagger`.
     %% Remember that Swagger-UI is embedded into `cowboy-swagger` project,
     %% within `priv/swagger` folder. BUT you have to reference that path,
     %% and depending on how you're using `cowboy-swagger` it will be different.
     %% For example, assuming that you want to run your app which has
     %% `cowboy-swagger` as dependency from the console, `static_files` will be:
     {static_files, "./deps/cowboy_swagger/priv/swagger"},

     %% `global_spec`: Global fields for Swagger specification.
     %% If these fields are not set, `cowboy_swagger` will set default values.
     {global_spec,
      #{swagger => "2.0",
        info => #{title => "Example API"},
        basePath => "/api-docs"
       }
     }
    ]
   }
  ].

  ```


  ### Definitions


  [Definitions](http://swagger.io/specification/#definitionsObject) can be used for describing

  [parameters](http://swagger.io/specification/#parametersDefinitionsObject),

  [responses](http://swagger.io/specification/#responsesDefinitionsObject) and

  [security](http://swagger.io/specification/#securityDefinitionsObject) schemas.


  For adding definitions to your app, you have 2 choices:


  1. Add a `definitions` key to your cowboy_swagger `global_spec` map.

  2. Add them by calling `cowboy_swagger:add_definition/2` and send the
     definition's name and properties.

  Let's say you want to describe a `POST` call to a `newspapers` endpoint that requires

  `name` and `description` fields only, you can do it like this:


  **Option 1:**

  ```erlang

  [ ... % other configurations

  , { cowboy_swagger
    , [ { global_spec
        , #{ swagger => "2.0"
           , info => #{title => "My app API"}
           , definitions => #{
               "RequestBody" =>
                 #{ "name" =>
                     #{ "type" => "string"
                      , "description" => "Newspaper name"
                      }
                  , "description" =>
                      #{ "type" => "string"
                       , "description" => "Newspaper description"
                       }
                  }
             }
           }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

  ```


  **Option 2:**


  For the second choice, you can do it for example in one or several `start_phases`,

  directly in your handler or any other place you want.


  ```erlang

  -spec trails() -> trails:trails().

  trails() ->
    DefinitionName = <<"RequestBody">>,
    DefinitionProperties =
      #{ <<"name">> =>
           #{ type => <<"string">>
            , description => <<"Newspaper name">>
            }
       , <<"description">> =>
           #{ type => <<"string">>
            , description => <<"Newspaper description">>
            }
       },
    % Add the definition
    ok = cowboy_swagger:add_definition(DefinitionName, DefinitionProperties),
    ...
  ```



  Now in your handler's trails callback function you can use it:


  ```erlang

  ...
    RequestBody =
      #{ name => <<"request body">>
       , in => body
       , description => <<"request body (as json)">>
       , required => true
         % Use the previously created `RequestBody' definition
       , schema => cowboy_swagger:schema(<<"RequestBody">>)
       },
    Metadata =
      #{ get =>
         #{ tags => ["newspapers"]
          , description => "Returns the list of newspapers"
          , produces => ["application/json"]
          }
       , post =>
         # { tags => ["newspapers"]
           , description => "Creates a new newspaper"
           , consumes => ["application/json"]
           , produces => ["application/json"]
           , parameters => [RequestBody] % and then use that parameter here
           }
       },
    Path = "/newspapers",
    Options = #{path => Path},
    [trails:trail(Path, newspapers_handler, Options, Metadata)].
  ```


  What this does for you is add a nice `response`, `parameter` or `security`

  model in swagger-ui, so client developers will know exactly what parameters

  the API expects for every endpoint.

  [swagger.io](http://swagger.io/) (v2.0) hook for Sails. The application's models, controllers, and routes are aggregated and transformed into a Swagger Document. Supports the Swagger 2.0 specification.


  ## Install


  ```sh

  $ npm install sails-swagger --save

  ```


  ## Configuration

  ```js

  // config/swagger.js

  module.exports.swagger = {
    /**
     * require() the package.json file for your Sails app.
     */
    pkg: require('../package'),
    ui: {
      url: 'http://swagger.balderdash.io'
    }
  };

  ```


  ## Usage

  After installing and configuring swagger, you can find the docs output on the [/swagger/doc](http://localhost:1337/swagger/doc) route.


  You may also specify additional swagger endpoints by specifying the swagger spec in config/routes.js


  ```

  /**
   * Route Mappings
   * @file config/routes.js
   * (sails.config.routes)
   *
   * Your routes map URLs to views and controllers.
   */

  module.exports.routes = {

      /***************************************************************************
       *                                                                          *
       * Make the view located at `views/homepage.ejs` (or `views/homepage.jade`, *
       * etc. depending on your default view engine) your home page.              *
       *                                                                          *

  ## swagger1st: A Swagger-First Clojure Ring handler


  ![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.zalando/swagger1st.svg)

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/swagger1st.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/swagger1st)

  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/zalando-stups/swagger1st/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/zalando-stups/swagger1st)


  swagger1st is a Clojure [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) handler that parses, validates and routes requests

  based on your [Swagger](http://swagger.io/)/OpenAPI definition. It takes the opposite approach of [ring-swagger](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger)—which enables you to generate your Swagger spec from your Clojure code—by allowing you to use your Swagger spec to generate Clojure code.


  Instead of defining routes and validation rules in your code, you can use swagger1st along with [Swagger/OpenAPI's great tool set](http://editor.swagger.io/) to specify your API according to the [Swagger/Open API 2.0 Specification](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec). This enables you to specify your API in an API-First, technology-independent format. The resulting definition is the ultimate format for publishing, sharing and reviewing your API.


  #### Compatibility Overview

  swagger1st aims to implement all of the Swagger/OpenAPI spec's features, so that you only have to write your business logic. [This document](https://github.com/zalando-stups/swagger1st/blob/master/comp-2.0.md) shows which aspects of the spec it currently supports.


  swagger1st will use the Swagger definition of your API as a configuration file for processing incoming requests—ensuring that your implementation and specification always remain in sync. During runtime, you can inspect and easily test

  your API with the built-in [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/). You can also extend the interpretation of

  your definition according to your own needs.


  Imagine a simple API definition like this:


  ```yaml

  swagger: '2.0'


  info:
    title: Example API
    version: '0.1'

  paths:
    /helloworld:
      get:
        summary: Returns a greeting.
        operationId: example.api/generate-greeting
        parameters:
          - name: firstname
            in: query
            type: string
            pattern: "^[A-Z][a-z]+"
        responses:
            200:
                description: say hello
  ```


  By default, this definition is connected to your business logic via the `operationId`, which might be defined like so:


  ```clojure

  (ns example.api
    (:require [ring.util.response :as r]))

  (defn generate-greeting [request]
    (let [firstname (-> request :parameters :query :firstname)]
      (-> (r/response (str "Hello " firstname "!"))
          (r/content-type "plain/text"))))
  ```


  This is all you need to do to define and implement your API. Only fully validated requests get to your function,

  so you can rely on swagger1st to properly check all input parameters according to your definition. The function itself

  is a normal Clojure function without any dependencies to swagger1st - simple as that.


  ### Quickstart


  The following provides instructions for simple, complex and manual setups. For all three approaches you'll need to install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) as the build tool.


  #### Simple Setup

  If you're bootstrapping a completely new project, or just want to try out swagger1st, you can use this Leiningen template:


  ```

  $ lein new swagger1st myproject

  $ cd myproject

  $ lein ring server-headless

  ```


  This will run a local web server on port 3000, so you can interact with the API at <http://localhost:3000/>. Also, you might want to have a look at <http://localhost:3000/ui/> for a graphical interface to explore and experiment with your API (using [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/)).


  ### Complex Setup


  To see how you can handle dependency injection with swagger1st, generate a project setup that includes Stuart Sierra's

  [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) framework:


  ```

  $ lein new swagger1st myproject +component

  $ cd myproject

  $ lein run -m myproject.core

  ```


  As with the simple setup above, this will launch a local web server on port 3000.


  ### Manual Setup


  The following steps describe how to manually set up swagger1st in a Clojure project. This is especially useful if you want to integrate it into an existing project or cannot use the provided template for other reasons.


  Use the following dependency in your [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) project:

      [org.zalando/swagger1st "<latest>"]

  This creates a Ring-compliant handler:


  ```clojure

  (ns example
    (:require [io.sarnowski.swagger1st.core :as s1st]
              [io.sarnowski.swagger1st.util.security :as s1stsec]))

  (def app
    (-> (s1st/context :yaml-cp "my-swagger-api.yaml")
        (s1st/discoverer)
        (s1st/mapper)
        (s1st/parser)
        (s1st/protector {"oauth2" (s1stsec/allow-all)})
        (s1st/executor)))
  ```


  ### Commands for Development


  ```shell

  # get the source

  $ git clone https://github.com/zalando-stups/swagger1st.git

  $ cd swagger1st


  # run the tests

  $ lein test


  # run all tests, including performance benchmarks

  $ lein test :all


  # build an own artifact for local development

  $ lein install


  # release a new version

  $ lein release :minor

  ```


  For interactive development, you can start a REPL by typing `lein repl`.


  ### Projects Using Swagger1st in Production


  - [Friboo](https://github.com/zalando/friboo), a utility library for writing microservices in Clojure, with support for Swagger and OAuth. It uses swagger1st at its base for RESTful HTTP endpoints and also integrates with the [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) framework.

  - [STUPS.io](https://stups.io/) components [Kio](https://github.com/zalando-stups/kio), [PierOne](https://github.com/zalando-stups/pierone) (a complete Docker registry based on S3), [Essentials](https://github.com/zalando-stups/essentials), [TWINTIP](https://github.com/zalando-stups/twintip-storage) and [mint](https://github.com/zalando-stups/mint-storage)


  ### The Ring Handler in Detail


  * `s1st/context` (required)
      * Creates a new context from a given definition. This context will be used by the next steps to prepare the
        execution of requests.
  * `s1st/discoverer` (optional)
      * The discoverer enables certain HTTP endpoints, that makes it easy to work with your API. In particular, this
        enables the Swagger UI under the path `/ui/` and exposes the Swagger definition under `/swagger.json`.
  * `s1st/mapper` (required)
      * The mapper denormalizes the given definition (e.g. resolves all `$ref`s) and figures out, which request definition
        maps to the actual incoming request. After this function, your `request` map contains the `:swagger` key, which
        contains a `:request` key containing the denormalized definition of the request and a `:key` key which can be used
        to uniquely identify a request.
  * `s1st/parser` (required)
      * The parser parses the incoming request according to the definition and validates all inputs.
  * `s1st/protector` (optional)
      * The protector can enforce all security definitions for you. As the security check implementations vary depending
        on your environment, this is only a framework to hook into the system and define callbacks for the actual checks.
  * `s1st/executor` (required)
      * The executor executes your defined function in the end. At this point, the whole definition was validated and only
        valid requests make it up until here. You can also specify an own function resolver function in order to hook into
        your own framework.

      // [Optional] Fill missing fields with dummy values
      converted.fillMissing();

      // [Optional] Validate converted spec
      return converted.validate()
        .then(function (result) {
          if (result.errors)
            return console.error(JSON.stringify(errors, null, 2));
          if (result.warnings)
            return console.error(JSON.stringify(warnings, null, 2));

          fs.writeFileSync('swagger2.json', converted.stringify());
        });
    });

  ## Compatibility


  - Play 2.4

  - Swagger (OpenAPI) 2.0


  ## Status


  This plugin should be enabled using the [play-swagger-service](http://www.typesafe.com/activator/template/play-swagger-service) activator template 

  as the version in this repository is under active development. The status of this software is beta, 

  an end-to-end functional release intended to demonstrate the possibility to generate following from a Swagger specification:


  - Play route files

  - Generators of random test data

  # Play-Swagger Tutorial


  This tutorial is based on the [play-swagger-service](http://www.typesafe.com/activator/template/play-swagger-service) activator template.


  ```bash

  $ activator new playground play-swagger-service

  ```


  The template project contains following:


  - `tutorial` folder with HTML tutorial

  - `public/swagger` folder containing static files needed for swagger UI

  - `project` folder containing pre-configured `plugins.sbt` file with a definition of all required resolvers and plugins

  - `conf` folder with following customized contents:
      * `routes` file with route configuration for Swagger UI, example specification and commented out links to other examples
      * `example.yaml`, a demo Swagger specification. The specification has a dummy implementation in `app` folder. 
      * `examples` folder containing other different Swagger specification examples. Each specification in this folder represents some aspect of the Play-Swagger plugin in more details.
          For the specification to be picked up by the plugin it must be moved into the `conf` folder. It is allowed to have multiple Swagger specifications in the `conf` folder at the same time. 
  - `app` directory with following template implementations:
      * `controllers/Swagger.scala` - a backend side of the Swagger UI
      * `generated_controllers/example.yaml.scala` - a dummy implementation of the example controller. Will be (re)generated if deleted
      * `security/example.yaml.scala` - a marshaller for OAuth2 tokens. Will not be regenerated until 
          a) deleted or renamed
          b) explicitly requested by issuing a `apiFirstSecurity` command 


  ## Welcome to Play-Swagger


  Congratulations, you just created a new Play-Swagger application!


  The [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) with the [Play-Swagger](https://github.com/zalando/play-Swagger/) 

  plugin make it easy to build RESTful web services from a Swagger API specification as the single source of truth. 

  Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture. Built on [Akka](http://akka.io), 

  Play provides predictable and minimal resource consumption for highly-scalable applications. 

  The Play-Swagger plugin takes Swagger API definitions and treats them as the single source of truth of your REST services.


  Play-Swagger supports round-trip regeneration and compilation of:


  - Play routes definitions (managed).

  - Swagger domain model definitions and parameters onto Scala case classes (managed).

  - Swagger domain model constraints onto Play validations (managed).

  - Generators for random test data generation of parameter values (managed).

  - Unit tests for validating your service at the API boundary (managed).

  - Swagger path definitions onto skeletons for Play controller implementations (unmanaged).


  In the list above, "(managed)" means that the code is managed by sbt. The code is not controlled 

  and altered by you, the programmer of the REST service. The plugin takes your Swagger API definition as the single 

  source of truth and regenerates these code parts in a consistent manner.

  You'll instead be focusing on implementing the service business logic in an (unmanaged) Play controller class 

  that is generated once. Subsequent regenerations keep the code that you have added, either by commenting out the 

  parts that are no longer valid, or by adding parts that are needed because you have made a change to the API.


  Manual generation and compilation of:


  - Security extractors

  - Unmarshallers for custom content types 


  is supported in the case if


  a) No security extractor or unmarshaller with the same name already exists

  b) The developer issues `apiFirstSecurity` or `apiFirstMarshallers` sbt command 


  ## Run Your Application


  Before we go any further, let's run the application.


  - Open a shell and `cd` into your service project directory.

  - Start `sbt` and `run` the service.

  - View the running application at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).


  The service template comes with the Swagger UI frontend included, 

  run statically from the within Play, which provides a sandbox for your service. 

  The template is configured with a template Swagger API definition called `example.yaml` 

  and located in the `conf` directory of the Play application. 


  The `example.yaml` definition provides an example [API description](https://github.com/zalando/play-swagger-service/blob/master/conf/example.yaml)


  This definition contains three end points: 

  - the `/token` path, which accept the `GET` and `POST` methods

  - the `/todos/{user_id}`, which accepts the `GET` method. 


  The `GET /token` API plays a role of an authentication server and is used by the Swagger UI for OAuth token requests.

  The `POST /token` API represents an authorization server and is used by the security part of the 

  generated code to validate OAuth tokens.
   
  The `GET /todos/{user_id}` takes a path parameter `user_id` and returns a TODO list for given user. 

  For the client to be allowed to access this endpoint, it must provide an OAuth token with the scope `admin:org`. 

  The token can be requested using the Swagger UI.


  Try it out for yourself: 


  Click the [default](http://localhost:9000/) button to expand the API definition in the Swagger UI.



  # Play Routes Integration


  As a Play application developer, you are used to defining your endpoints in the `conf/routes` file. 

  Not so with the Play-Swagger plugin! Swagger API specifications already define endpoints as `path` definitions, 

  as seen in the example above. So why do the work twice, right? Instead, the Play-Swagger plugin requires you to 

  link your API definition in the routes file ones—making all Swagger API-defined endpoints available as children 

  of one single path context location, and generating Play route definitions from them (as shown below):


  ```

  ->      /example        example.yaml.Routes

  ```


  Note that the `conf/routes` file provided by this activator template also contains a couple of additional `GET` 

  mappings required for the the Swagger UI sandbox.


  There are a couple of commented out links to other examples. If you activate some specification by moving it from 

  the `examples` folder into the `conf` folder, you'll need to uncomment an appropriate line in the `routes` file in

  order for play to be able to find it.  



  ## Swagger Domain Definitions


  Scala domain model definitions are generated for all data types defined as Swagger parameters in an API specification. 

  Swagger parameters can be of path, query, header, form or body types, and consist of either primitive data types or 

  more complex types composed from objects and arrays with primitives as leaves. 


  Both primitive types and complex types are mapped to scala.


  As an example, let's look at the Swagger API specification file [`simple.petstore.api.yaml`](https://github.com/zalando/play-swagger-service/blob/master/conf/examples/simple.petstore.api.yaml), 

  which defines the API of a simple pet store. It contains a model definition for a pet.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    pet:
      required:
        - id
        - name
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
        name:
          type: string
        tag:
          type: string
  ```


  This definition consists of an object `pet` containing the required properties `id` and `name` 

  and the optional property `tag`. The Swagger primitive types of these properties are a 64-bit `integer` 

  and (twice) a `string`, successively.  The Play-Swagger plugin will map this definition on to a generated Scala model.


  ```scala

  package simple.petstore.api


  package object yaml {

      type PetTag = Option[String]

      case class Pet(id: Long, name: String, tag: PetTag)
  }

  ```


  This generated model contains a type definition `PetTag`, which declares a type alias for the optional `tag` property, 

  and a `Pet` case class with the properties as named in the Swagger API definition and mapped on the subsequent 

  Scala primitive or declared types. The case class and type alias are generated in an package object `yaml`, 

  this package  object itself is contained in the package `simple.petstore.api` so that full object name corresponds 

  to the API filename.


  Note that models are generated within a Play application as _managed_ code in the target folder. 

  Generated model code is not intended to be altered.  We should instead look upon the Swagger definition as the single 

  source of truth, and as the source code that defines our model.

  The Swagger specification file of our API is, in that sense, part of the codebase. 

  Even though the generated `Pet` case class is managed by the plugin, and not us, it can (of course) 

  be used in our application codebase after being imported.


  ```scala

  import simple.petstore.api.yaml._


  val pet = Pet(0L, "Tucker", Some("Greyhound"))

  ```


  ## Specification Cross-References


  A `$ref` element of the specification is allowed to contain a name of file as it's part. Because of this, it is possible to split 

  a single specification into multiple files as shown in [`cross_spec_references.yaml`](https://github.com/zalando/play-swagger-service/blob/master/conf/examples/cross_spec_references.yaml) 

  example. It is also possible to reference a definition in one specification from another specification. 

  In this case for each reference an independent copy of the class definition will be created for each referencing specification. 

  The definition is then placed into the appropriate package for each specification. 


  Thus, even if multiple classes with  the same name and structure might be generated, they all will coexist in their 

  own separate namespaces and won't be interchangeable.



  ## Primitive Types


  Swagger version 2.0 allows for primitive data types based on the types defined by 

  [JSON-Schema](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html#anchor8).


  When generated as Scala, the following mapping applies:


  | Common Name | Swagger Type | Swagger Format | Scala Type                                  |

  |-------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|

  | integer     | integer      | int32          | scala.Int                                   |

  | long        | integer      | int64          | scala.Long                                  |

  | float       | number       | float          | scala.Float                                 |

  | double      | number       | double         | scala.Double                                |

  | big int     | integer      |                | scala.math.BigInt                           |

  | big decimal | number       |                | scala.math.BigDecimal                       |

  | boolean     | boolean      |                | scala.Boolean                               |

  | string      | string       |                | scala.String                                |

  | byte        | string       | byte           | de.zalando.play.controllers.Base64String    |

  | binary      | string       | binary         | de.zalando.play.controllers.BinaryString    |

  | date        | string       | date           | org.joda.time.LocalDate                     |

  | datetime    | string       | date-time      | org.joda.time.DateTime                      |

  | password    | string       | password       | scala.String                                |

  | file        | file         |                | java.io.File                                |


  Additionally, if a validation of type "enum" is defined for some primitive type, a trait and a set of case objects forming an ADT 

  will be generated for this enum.


  ## Complex Types


  Complex types are made up of primitive objects, or nested objects.


  ### Objects


  Complex object types are defined in Swagger model definitions as either objects or arrays.


  Objects are, again, based on the [JSON-Schema](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html#anchor8) specification 

  and defined as Swagger [Schema Objects](https://github.com/Swagger-api/Swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schema-object) 

  for parameter definitions of `type: "object"`.

  For example, given a Swagger API definition file `api.yaml` containing a model that defines a `person` as an object 

  with the properties `name` and `age` of the primitive types `string` and `integer` subsequently, 

  this object will be mapped on a Scala case class, and generated in a Scala package object (namespace) with the same name 

  as the extension of the file the specification is read from and in a package with the same name as the 

  Swagger definition file in which the model is defined—that is, `api`


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    person:
      type: object
      required:
        - name
        - age
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        age:
          type: integer
          format: int32
  ```


  Is generated into:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      case class Person(name: String, age: Int) 
  }

  ```


  ### Nested Objects


  Nested objects are generated adjourned but referenced hierarchically. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    parent:
      type: object
      required:
        - child
      properties:
        child:
          type: object
          required:
            - name
          properties:
            name:
              type: string
  ```


  Is generated into:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      case class Parent(child: ParentChild) 
      case class ParentChild(name: String) 
  }


  ```


  ### Optionality


  Swagger, by default, defines object properties to be optional, which can be overridden by providing a list of `required` 

  object properties as already used in the examples above. Optional properties are mapped upon Scala's `Option` type, 

  for which a type alias is generated for each property that is optional. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    product:
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        tag:
          type: string
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      type ProductTag = Option[String]
      case class Product(name: String, tag: ProductTag) 
  }


  ```


  As objects can be nested, so can object property optionality. To facilitate for nested optionality, we generate a nested scala `Option` type alias. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    Basic:
      properties:
        optional:
          type: object
          properties:
            nested:
              type: string
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      type BasicOptional = Option[BasicOptionalOpt]
      type BasicOptionalNested = Option[String]

      case class BasicOptionalOpt(nested: BasicOptionalNested) 
      case class Basic(optional: BasicOptional) 
  }

  ```



  ### Parameter optionality


  As object properties can be optional, so can be query, header, body or form parameters. 

  In the case if they are not required, they are mapped to the Scala's `Option` type. 


  Path parameters are _must_ be declared as required.


  In the case, if a parameter is _not_ required, it is allowed to have a default value.



  ### Extension


  Objects can extend other objects via employment of Swagger's `allOff` property. In the example below, the `ExtendedErrorModel` inherits _all of_ the properties of the `ErrorModel` which it refers to—that is, the properties `message` and `code`—and _extends_ this model with the property `rootCause`. Swagger object extension is mapped by duplicating inherited properties in the object that extends. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    ErrorModel:
      type: object
      required:
      - message
      - code
      properties:
        message:
          type: string
        code:
          type: integer
    ExtendedErrorModel:
      allOf:
      - $ref: '#/definitions/ErrorModel'
      - type: object
        required:
        - rootCause
        properties:
          rootCause:
            type: string
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
    import scala.math.BigInt
    case class ErrorModel(message: String, code: BigInt) 
    case class ExtendedErrorModel(message: String, code: BigInt, rootCause: String) 
  }


  ```


  ### Polymorphism


  Polymorphic object definitions are possible through employment of the Swagger `discriminator` property. 

  In the example definition below, an abstract `Pet` defines what concrete `Cat` and `Dog`s have in common. 

  Swagger object models define data, so a discriminator property is required to distinguish concrete cat and dog 

  instances as they are serialised to and from the API. In this sense, the discriminator property works 

  in the same way as a discriminator column works in ORM frameworks when mapping a class hierarchy onto a single table. 

  It simply contains a value that maps onto one of the concrete types—for example, `petType: "Cat"` or `petType: "Dog"`.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    Pet:
      discriminator: petType
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        petType:
          type: string
      required:
      - name
      - petType
    Cat:
      allOf:
      - $ref: '#/definitions/Pet'
      - properties:
          huntingSkill:
            type: string
            default: lazy
            enum:
            - clueless
            - lazy
            - adventurous
            - aggressive
        required:
        - huntingSkill
    Dog:
      allOf:
      - $ref: '#/definitions/Pet'
      - properties:
          packSize:
            type: integer
            format: int32
        required:
        - packSize
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api


  package object yaml {

      trait IPet {
          def name: String
          def petType: String
      }

      case class Cat(name: String, petType: String, huntingSkill: CatHuntingSkill) extends IPet
      case class Dog(name: String, petType: String, packSize: Int) extends IPet
      case class Pet(name: String, petType: String) extends IPet

      sealed trait CatHuntingSkill { def value: String }
      case object Clueless extends CatHuntingSkill { val value = "clueless" }
      case object Lazy extends CatHuntingSkill { val value = "lazy" }
      case object Adventurous extends CatHuntingSkill { val value = "adventurous" }
      case object Aggressive extends CatHuntingSkill { val value = "aggressive" }
      implicit def stringToCatHuntingSkill(in: String): CatHuntingSkill = in match {
          case "clueless" => Clueless
          case "lazy" => Lazy
          case "adventurous" => Adventurous
          case "aggressive" => Aggressive
      }
  }


  ```


  Please note how the enumeration of cat's `huntingSkill`'s get's translated into the ADT with a sealed trait `CatHuntingSkill`

  and four case objects implementing that trait.


  ### Additional Properties


  Swagger's model language allows objects' additional properties to be loosely defined employing the `additionalProperties` annotation 

  in order to model dictionaries. These dictionaries are mapped to Scala's `Map` type, for which a type alias is 

  generated following the same (by now) well-known pattern as for optional properties, with the map's key parameter type being a Scala `String`.


  A Swagger additional property definition takes as its type property the element type of the dictionary, 

  which can be of primitive or complex type and which is mapped on Scala as the map's value parameter type. 

  Swagger allows for one `additionalProperties` annotation per object definition, so we can generate this Scala parameter 

  with the static name `additionalProperties`.


  In the following example we define a Swagger model object definition `KeyedArray` that uses the `additionalProperties` 

  annotation to provide the object with a set of key value mappings from string to array. E.g.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    KeyedArrays:
      type: object
      additionalProperties:
        type: array
        items:
          type: integer
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api


  package object yaml {

      import de.zalando.play.controllers.ArrayWrapper
      import scala.math.BigInt
      import scala.collection.immutable.Map

      type KeyedArraysAdditionalPropertiesCatchAll = ArrayWrapper[BigInt]
      type KeyedArraysAdditionalProperties = Map[String, KeyedArraysAdditionalPropertiesCatchAll]
      case class KeyedArrays(additionalProperties: KeyedArraysAdditionalProperties) 
  }

  ```


  ## Arrays


  Swagger's `array` is used to define properties that hold sets or lists of model values—possibly of a primitive type, 

  but complex element types are also allowed. Depending on the place where the array definition appears, Swagger array can be mapped to one of two Scala types, parametrised for the element type that it contains:

  - if an array only defined inline as a part of the response definition, it is translated to a `Seq` type

  - otherwise (array appears in the parameter definition or in the `definitions` part of the specification) it is 

  defined as a `de.zalando.play.controllers.ArrayWrapper`


  For example, in the snippet below, an `Activity` object definition is referred to as an item element in the 

  `messages` property of `type: array` of the containing object definition `Example`. 

  A Scala type alias will be generated for the array type (just as we've seen before with optional properties), 

  after which the array-containing property can be generated within the case class as being of this alias type. 

  E.g. in the Swagger definition and code


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    Activity:
      type: object
      required:
      - actions
      properties:
        actions:
          type: string
    Example:
      type: object
      required:
      - messages
      properties:
        messages:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Activity'
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api


  package object yaml {

      import de.zalando.play.controllers.ArrayWrapper

      type ExampleMessages = ArrayWrapper[Activity]

      case class Activity(actions: String) 
      case class Example(messages: ExampleMessages) 
  }


  ```


  If the description of the same array is inlined as a part of the response definition like that:


  ```yaml

  paths:
    /api:
      get:
        responses:
          200:
            schema:
              type: object
              required:
              - messages
              properties:
                messages:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: '#/definitions/Activity'
            description: array payload
  definitions:
    Activity:
      type: object
      required:
      - actions
      properties:
        actions:
          type: string
  ```


  than the `Seq` scala type will be used:

  ```scala

  package api

  package object yaml {
      type ApiGetResponses200Messages = Seq[Activity]
      case class Activity(actions: String) 
      case class ApiGetResponses200(messages: ApiGetResponses200Messages) 
  }

  ```



  ### Nested Arrays


  Array definition types can be nested and are possibly optional. 

  The following (contrived) snippet depicts the generated Scala code when both definition types are 

  employed in a somewhat non-useful manner. The intent of this example is to show that the case 

  class definitions are rather concisely generated, even though a stack of type aliases is needed 

  to make sure that we still refer in Scala code to an aptly named Swagger definition—especially 

  in conjunction with the object properties being optional. Next to its benefits, 

  type safety against `null` pointers does have an associated cost as well.


  ```yaml

  definitions:
    Activity:
      type: object
      properties:
        actions:
          type: string
    Example:
      type: object
      properties:
        messages:
          type: array
          items:
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: '#/definitions/Activity'
        nested:
          type: array
          items:
            type: array
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: string
  ```


  Which is generated as:


  ```scala

  package api


  package object yaml {

      import de.zalando.play.controllers.ArrayWrapper

      type ExampleMessagesOpt = ArrayWrapper[ExampleMessagesOptArr]
      type ExampleMessages = Option[ExampleMessagesOpt]
      type ExampleNested = Option[ExampleNestedOpt]
      type ExampleMessagesOptArr = ArrayWrapper[Activity]
      type ExampleNestedOptArrArrArr = ArrayWrapper[String]
      type ExampleNestedOptArrArr = ArrayWrapper[ExampleNestedOptArrArrArr]
      type ActivityActions = Option[String]
      type ExampleNestedOptArr = ArrayWrapper[ExampleNestedOptArrArr]
      type ExampleNestedOpt = ArrayWrapper[ExampleNestedOptArr]

      case class Activity(actions: ActivityActions) 
      case class Example(messages: ExampleMessages, nested: ExampleNested) 
  }


  ```


  ## Swagger Validations


  Swagger API definitions allow for constraints to be put on parameter types. 

  We have already seen the `required` constraint, used to mark a parameter or specific field within 

  a domain definition to be required upon input. Additional constraints, as defined by the 

  [Parameter Object](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterObject), 

  can be added to your API definition. The Play-Swagger plugin will generate validations for these parameter 

  constraints and make sure that your controller methods are only called if the input of your service 

  complies to those constraints. 


  In the example below, the API definition of the `token` parameter of 

  type `Base64String`, as the form parameter, contains validation rules for the lenght of the perameter as well as a regexp pattern the value of the parameter must confirm to.

  The parameter is also required.


  ```yaml

  ...

  parameters:
        - name: token
          in: formData
          description: oauth2 token
          type: string
          format: byte
          pattern: "[A-Za-z0-9]*"
          minLength: 5
          maxLength: 100
          required: true
  ...

  ```


  Let's take another example:


  ```yaml

  ...
      get:
        parameters:
        - name: state
          in: query
          description: Any application state to be forwarded back to the frontend
          type: string
          minLength: 1
          maxLength: 110
          required: false
  ...

  ```


  The `state` parameter is of type string, is not required and has no default value. 

  It is also only allowed to have a state of length between 1 and 110, otherwise it won't pass validation. 

  For the demo purposes, let's change it's type to `integer` and make it required. 


  As the parameter is required now, the `default` value cannot be present. The `maxLength` and `maxLength` validations 

  are not allowed for integer parameters, therefore let's replace them with `minimum` and `maximum` values:
      
  ```yaml

  ...
      get:
        parameters:
        - name: state
          in: query
          description: Any application state to be forwarded back to the frontend
          type: integer
          format: int32
          required: true
          minimum: 2000
          maximum: 2100      
  ...

  ```    



  As we just changed the parameter type, refreshing Swagger UI will, in addition to generating validations 

  for that parameter type, also force a regeneration of the model consistent with the validation. 

  That's nice, but note that it will break the current implementation of the controller class, as the 

  implementation of the `postAction` expects `state` to be of type `String`.


  ![Validation screenshot](/docs/validations-01.png)


  Let's change the implementation. The second parameter `state` is no longer 

  of type `Option[String]` but of type `Int`. We change the implementation to take this fact into the account:


  ```scala

  ...

  val tokenGet = tokenGetAction { input: (String, String, String, Int) =>
      val (redirect_uri, scope, response_type, state) = input
      // ----- Start of unmanaged code area for action  TokenService.tokenGet
      val statePart = s"""state=$state"""
  ...

  }

  ```


  Refreshing Swagger UI and trying out a couple of integer values for `state` shows that the service 

  now excepts value within the range `[2000..2100]`, but returns a descriptive error when outside. I.e.


  ```json

  [
    {
      "messages": [
        "error.max"
      ],
      "args": [
        2100
      ]
    }
  ]

  ```


  ## Test Generators


  Having an API definition as the single source of truth in your codebase—with formal type specification of the in- and output values, 

  including their constraints—provides for a powerful feature when it comes to testing. 

  The Play-Swagger plugin automates the creation of test data generators that can drive property checks directly 

  from the API specification. Play-Swagger derives data generators and unit tests directly from your Swagger API specification.


  Property-based testing using generator-driven property checks is a cool way to test the validity of your application 

  according to the rules or properties that apply to your application. Properties, in this sense, are high-level 

  specifications that should always hold for a range of data values. The idea is to generate a range of data 

  values for your data types and let (also generated) tests assert that the properties of these data types hold. 

  A Swagger API definition contains formal type definitions _and_ constraints for all data values, and the Play-Swagger 

  plugin maps these types on managed Scala source code that represents the data types, so it is also possible to map 

  these API definitions on test data generators that provide a range of data values for these types. 

  The plugin does exactly that: It creates managed test data generators and unit tests that assert whether your 

  application still complies to your specification. It does so in a single-source-of-truth manner, 

  taking the Swagger API definition as the source.


  We employ the ScalaTest [property-based testing](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/property_based_testing) 

  functionality as the framework to generate the data values, and map the data types of our API definition on 

  the test data generators that are created by the plugin. ScalaTest provides 

  `org.scalacheck.Gen` and `org.scalacheck.Arbitrary` objects with utility methods that help generate a range of 

  (possibly arbitrary) data values for common Scala types and primitives. The Play-Swagger plugin uses these 

  methods to create test data generators specific for the data types of our API definition. When necessary, 

  it composes generators from primitive types into generators for complex types, so that you end up with a 

  set of generators that provide test data for your complete API.


  As an example, let's take the API definition for the simple pet store—trimmed down to the parts defining 

  parameter types, and (for brevity) omitting any non-data definitions and error definitions:


  ```yaml

  paths:
    /pets:
      get:
        parameters:
          - name: limit
            in: query
            required: false
            type: integer
            format: int32
        responses:
          default:
            description: error payload
      post:
        parameters:
          - name: pet
            in: body
            required: true
            schema:
              $ref: '#/definitions/newPet'
        responses:
          default:
            description: error payload
    /pets/{id}:
      get:
        parameters:
          - name: id
            in: path
            required: true
            type: integer
            format: int64
        responses:
          default:
            description: error payload
      delete:
        parameters:
          - name: id
            in: path
            required: true
            type: integer
            format: int64
        responses:
          default:
            description: error payload
  definitions:
    pet:
      required:
        - id
        - name
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
        name:
          type: string
        tag:
          type: string
    newPet:
        required:
          - name
        properties:
          id:
            type: integer
            format: int64
          name:
            type: string
          tag:
            type: string
  ```


  The `get` method on path `/pets` takes an optional `limit` parameter of common type `integer`. 

  The `post` method takes a `newPet` body parameter comprising of the primitive attributes `id`, `name` and `tag`, 

  subsequently of common types `long` and `string` (twice). Of these, only the `name` attribute is mandatory. 

  The `get` method on the path `/pets/{id}` takes the path parameter `id` of common type `long` and returns 

  an array of `pet`s consisting of the same attributes and primitive types as a `newPet` - but this time 

  with both `name` and `id` being mandatory. This specification maps to the following managed Scala domain model code:



  ```scala

  package example


  package object yaml {

      import de.zalando.play.controllers.PlayPathBindables

      type PetsIdDeleteResponsesDefault = Null
      type NewPetTag = Option[String]
      type PetsIdDeleteId = Long
      type PetsGetLimit = Option[Int]
      type NewPetId = Option[Long]

      case class Pet(id: Long, name: String, tag: NewPetTag) 
      case class NewPet(name: String, id: NewPetId, tag: NewPetTag) 

      implicit val bindable_OptionIntQuery = PlayPathBindables.createOptionQueryBindable[Int]
  }

  ```


  We want to have test data generators that generate an arbitrary range of values for the model 

  code shown above - composed from primitive, and sometimes optional, data definitions. 

  The Play-Swagger plugin does this by generating two Scala objects: one for the Swagger API definition, 

  and one for the API path parts. Each object contains generator factory methods for the defined data types, 

  prefixed by `create`, which returns a generator function. A generator function takes a given integer count 

  and returns a generated amount of test data for the data type it was created for.


  Data types are composed from primitive types, Scala optional types, and possibly more complex types. 

  Test data values for the primitive types are generated arbitrarily, employing the ScalaCheck 

  `org.scalacheck.Arbitrary.arbitrary[T]` method (the type parameter, replaced with Scala's primitive type, 

  on which the Swagger common type is mapped).


  In the code shown below, starting with primitive leaf data values, the `pet` parameter's attribute `id` 

  of common type `long` is arbitrarily generated from a `scala.Long`.  Note that the `id` attribute is optional, 

  though, for the `newPet` definition. As with the generated model, we created a `NewPetIdGenerator` value that 

  takes an arbitrarily generated `scala.Long` id value and generates an option value from it, employing the 

  ScalaCheck `org.scalacheck.Gen.option[T]`.  This generator will generate test data values comprising of `None` 

  and `Some` arbitrarily id value. It's probably best to let the Scala generator code speak for itself. 

  Note how it composes according to the same structure as the Scala model code.


  ```scala

  package example.yaml


  import org.scalacheck.Gen

  import org.scalacheck.Arbitrary

  import play.api.libs.json.scalacheck.JsValueGenerators

  import Arbitrary._


  object Generators extends JsValueGenerators {

      def createNullGenerator = _generate(NullGenerator)
      def createNewPetTagGenerator = _generate(NewPetTagGenerator)
      def createLongGenerator = _generate(LongGenerator)
      def createPetsGetLimitGenerator = _generate(PetsGetLimitGenerator)
      def createNewPetIdGenerator = _generate(NewPetIdGenerator)

      def createPetGenerator = _generate(PetGenerator)
      def createNewPetGenerator = _generate(NewPetGenerator)

      def NullGenerator = arbitrary[Null]
      def NewPetTagGenerator = Gen.option(arbitrary[String])
      def LongGenerator = arbitrary[Long]
      def PetsGetLimitGenerator = Gen.option(arbitrary[Int])
      def NewPetIdGenerator = Gen.option(arbitrary[Long])

      def PetGenerator = for {
          id <- arbitrary[Long]
          name <- arbitrary[String]
          tag <- NewPetTagGenerator
      } yield Pet(id, name, tag)
      def NewPetGenerator = for {
          name <- arbitrary[String]
          id <- NewPetIdGenerator
          tag <- NewPetTagGenerator
      } yield NewPet(name, id, tag)

      def _generate[T](gen: Gen[T]) = (count: Int) => for (i <- 1 to count) yield gen.sample
  }

  ```


  A `PetGenerator` and `NewPetGenerator` are created and implemented by the plugin as a for comprehension 

  that generates data values for each attribute, yielding an instance of a test pet. Other generators follow 

  the same pattern but, if necessary, delegate to different child generators. From this we acquire a set of 

  test data generators to implement our property-based testing.


  Running the test is as simple as running a test set from sbt. Just type `test` from your `sbt` prompt.


  # Building a Play-Swagger Plugin


  To build a plugin, do the following:


  - Clone the repository to your local filesystem

  - Run ```sbt +publishLocal``` in the Play-Swagger directory. This will publish the plugin into your local ivy repository


  To use the plugin in a plain Play project:


  - Create a new Play-Swagger project using activator template, for example: ```activator new hello-world play-swagger-service```

  - Take a look at the `project/plugins.sbt` of the generated project and add required plugins and resolvers to the `project/plugins.sbt` of your Play project

  - Do the same for `build.sbt`

  - Put a Swagger specification with a ```.yaml``` or ```.json``` extension into the ```conf``` directory

  - Add a specification link (`->`) to the play's routes file



  ## Plugin Architecture


  Ths Play-Swagger plugin has a three-tier architecture:


  * specification - this tier is responsible for finding and parsing a specification and converting it into the raw AST format

  * normalisation - this tier performs a couple of optimisations on the AST including type deduplication, flattening and parameter dereferencing

  * generation - a final step including transformation of the AST into the source-code related data and generation of source code from it   


  The separation of the specification and generation tiers allows for plugging in different specification standards 

  and generating source code for different frameworks.



  ## Plugin Project Structure


  There are a couple of sub-projects:


  * `swagger-model` - A standalone Scala Swagger model and a Jackson parser for it. Can be used by another projects

  * `api` - This is the project that's automatically added to the runtime classpath of any projects that use this plugin.

  * `swagger-parser` - A converter of the Swagger model to the internal AST of the plugin

  * `api-first-core` - This is a core of the plugin with minimal functionality. It includes defining an AST structure and some transformations on AST.  

  * `play-scala-generator` - The standalone generator for transforming an AST into the skeleton of Play-Scala application. 

  * `plugin` - A coupble of sbt plugins, one for each tier:
      - `ApiFirstSwaggerParser` - a plugin wrapping Swagger parsing part 
      - `ApiFirstCore` - a wrapper for AST-related functionality
      - `ApiFirstPlayScalaCodeGenerator` - a wrapper for the Play-Scala generator

  Because of the modular plugin architecture, all modules must be enabled separatly in sbt's build.sbt. 

  It is also necessary to configure which parser(s) must be used by the plugin, like that: 


  ```scala

  lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayScala, ApiFirstCore, ApiFirstPlayScalaCodeGenerator, ApiFirstSwaggerParser)


  apiFirstParsers := Seq(ApiFirstSwaggerParser.swaggerSpec2Ast.value).flatten

  ```


  Please take a look at activator template's configuration for complete example.



  ## Custom Templates For Code Generation


  The PlayScala generator supports custom templates. In order to override default template for some of the components,

  please provide your custom template named in accordance to the following list:

      * `play_scala_test.mustache` - for unit tests
      * `play_validation.mustache` - for validators 
      * `generators.mustache` - for test data generators
      * `model.mustache` - for model classes and query and path bindables
      * `play_scala_controller_base.mustache` - for play controller bases 
      * `play_scala_controller_security.mustache` - for security adapters used by controller bases
      * `play_scala_form_parser.mustache` - for form parsers used by the controller bases
      * `play_scala_controller.mustache` - for play controller skeletons supposed to be augmented by the programmer
      * `play_scala_response_writers.mustache` - for custom serializers to be augmented by the programmer
      * `play_scala_security_extractors.mustache` - for custom security extractors to be augmented by the programmer 


  Please be aware that generated artifacts need to preserve some specific shape in order to be compiled together without errors.


  The location where custom templates reside needs to be configured by overriding the plugin setting `playScalaCustomTemplateLocation`.


  For example following configuration will set this place to be `conf/templates` folder of the project:

  ```scala

  playScalaCustomTemplateLocation := Some(((resourceDirectory in Compile) / "templates").value)

  ```



  ## Plugin Developing


  sbt doesn't allow sub-projects to depend on each other as sbt plugins. To test an sbt plugin, you need a separate 

  project.  This project is `swagger-tester`.  To test your changes as you're developing the plugin, cd into this 

  directory, and run sbt. This project uses an sbt `ProjectRef` to the sbt plugin, which means you don't need to 

  `publishLocal` the plugin after each change. Just run `reload` in the sbt console, and it will pick up your changes.


  The play-swagger plugin provides a couple of commands useful for development: 


  * `apiFirstPrintDenotations` - outputs a common names of different parts of the AST as they are intended to be used in generated Scala code

  * `apiFirstPrintRawAstTypes` - outputs all type definitions as they read from the specification before type optimisations

  * `apiFirstPrintRawAstParameters` - outputs all parameters definitions before type optimisations

  * `apiFirstPrintFlatAstTypes` - outputs type definitions after type optimisations

  * `apiFirstPrintFlatAstParameters` - outputs parameter definitions after type optimisations



  ## Plugin Testing


  We're using the sbt scripted framework for testing. You can find the tests in `plugin/src/sbt-test`, and run them 

  by running `scripted` in the sbt console.



  ## Code quality


  There are some quality checks embedded into the build script:

  * the source code is (re)formatted using [scalariform](https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform) each time it is compiled (currently deactivated).

  * [`scalastyle`](http://www.scalastyle.org) sbt command shall be used to perform code style checks before putting changes into the repository.

  * [`lint:compile`](https://github.com/HairyFotr/linter) sbt command shall be used to perform static code analysis before putting changes into the repository.

  * code coverage for api and compiler modules can be executed by issuing `sbt clean coverage test` command for these 

  projects. Coverage statistics can be generated using `coverageReport` sbt command.

  ## FAQ

  Q&A contributed by the community:


  <https://goswagger.io/faq/>


  ## How is this different from go generator in swagger-codegen?

  **tl;dr** The main difference at this moment is that this one actually works...


  The swagger-codegen project only generates a _workable_ go client and even there it will only support flat models.

  Further, the go server generated by swagger-codegen is mostly a stub.


  > **Motivation**

  > Why is this not done as a part of the swagger-codegen project? Because:

  >

  > * I don't really know java very well and so I'd be learning both java and the object model of the codegen which was in heavy flux as opposed to doing go and I really wanted to go experience of designing a large codebase with it.

  > * Go's super limited type system makes it so that it doesn't fit well in the model of swagger-codegen

  > * Go's idea of polymorphism doesn't reconcile very well with a solution designed for languages that actually have inheritance and so forth.

  > * For supporting types like `[][][]map[string][][]int64` I don't think it's possible with mustache

  >

  > I gravely underestimated the amount of work that would be involved in making something useful out of it.

  > My personal mission: I want the jvm to go away, it was great way back when now it's just silly (vm in container on vm in vm in container)

  - A [typed JSON Schema implementation](https://goswagger.io/use/model.html), supporting most Draft 4 features

  - Extended string and numeric formats: [strfmt](https://github.com/go-openapi/strfmt)

  - Utilities to work with JSON, convert data types and pointers: [swag](https://github.com/go-openapi/swag)

  - A jsonschema (Draft 4) validator, with full $ref support: [validate](https://github.com/go-openapi/validate)

  - Custom validation interface


  ## Installing

  `go-swagger` is available as binary or docker releases as well as from source: [more details](https://goswagger.io/install.html).


  ## Use-cases

  The main package of the toolkit, go-swagger/go-swagger, provides command line tools to help working with swagger.


  The toolkit is highly customizable and allows endless possibilities to work with OpenAPI2.0 specifications.


  Beside the go-swagger CLI tool and generator, the [go-openapi packages](https://github.com/go-openapi) provide modular functionality to build custom solutions on top of OpenAPI.


  The CLI supports shell autocompletion utilities: see [here](https://goswagger.io/cli_helpers.html).


  ### Serve specification UI

  Most basic use-case: serve a UI for your spec:


  ```

  swagger serve https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json

  ```


  ### Validate a specification

  To [validate](https://goswagger.io/usage/validate.html) a Swagger specification:


  ```

  swagger validate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json

  ```


  ### Generate an API server

  To generate a [server for a swagger spec](https://goswagger.io/generate/server.html) document:


  ```

  swagger generate server [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]

  ```


  ### Generate an API client

  To generate a [client for a swagger spec](https://goswagger.io/generate/client.html) document:


  ```

  swagger generate client [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]

  ```


  ### Generate a spec from source

  To generate a [swagger spec document for a go application](https://goswagger.io/generate/spec.html):


  ```

  swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json

  ```


  ### Generate a data model

  To generate model structures and validators exposed by the API:


  ```

  swagger generate model --spec={spec}

  ```


  ### Transform specs


  There are [several commands](https://goswagger.io/use/transform.html) allowing you to transform your spec.


  Resolve and expand $ref's in your spec as inline definitions:

  ```

  swagger expand {spec}

  ```


  Flatten your spec: all external $ref's are imported into the main document and inline schemas reorganized as definitions.

  ```

  swagger flatten {spec}

  ```


  Merge specifications (composition):

  ```

  swagger mixin {spec1} {spec2}

  ```


  ### Compare specs


  The  diff command allows you to check backwards compatibility.

  Type ```swagger diff --help``` for info.


  ```

  swagger diff {spec1} {spec2}

  ```

  ## Note to users migrating from older releases


  ### Using 0.5.0


  Because 0.5.0 and master have diverged significantly, you should checkout the tag 0.5.0 for go-swagger when you use the currently released version.


  ### Migrating from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0


  You will have to rename some imports:


  ```

  github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/httpkit/validate to github.com/go-openapi/validate

  github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/httpkit to github.com/go-openapi/runtime

  github.com/naoina/denco to github.com/go-openapi/runtime/middleware/denco

  github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger to github.com/go-openapi

  ```


  ### Migrating from 0.12 to 0.13


  Spec flattening and $ref resolution brought breaking changes in model generation, since all complex things generate their own definitions.


  ### Migrating from 0.14 to 0.15


  Generated servers no more import the following package (replaced by go1.8 native functionality):

  ```

  github.com/tylerb/graceful

  ```


  Spec flattening now defaults to minimal changes to models and should be workable for 0.12 users.


  Users who prefer to stick to 0.13 and 0.14 default flattening mode may now use the `--with-flatten=full` option.


  Note that the `--skip-flatten` option has been phased out and replaced by the more explicit `--with-expand` option.

  # hapi-openapi


  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krakenjs/hapi-openapi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krakenjs/hapi-openapi)

  [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hapi-openapi.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hapi-openapi)


  ### Note: this project was renamed from 'swaggerize-hapi' to 'hapi-openapi'.


  `hapi-openapi` is a design-driven approach to building RESTful services with [OpenAPI (Swagger)](http://openapis.org) and [Hapi](http://hapijs.com) (OpenAPI 3.0 support coming soon).


  `hapi-openapi` provides the following features:


  - API schema validation.

  - Routes based on the OpenAPI document.

  - API documentation route.

  - Input validation.


  ### Why "Design Driven"


  There are already a number of modules that help build RESTful APIs for node with OpenAPI. However,

  these modules tend to focus on building the documentation or specification as a side effect of writing

  the application business logic.


  `hapi-openapi` begins with the OpenAPI document first. This facilitates writing APIs that are easier to design, review, and test.


  At runtime, `hapi-openapi` uses the API specification to build routes from previously defined paths. This ensures that everything specified is what is implemented.


  ### Quick Start with a Generator


  This guide will let you go from an `api.json` to a service project in no time flat.


  First install `generator-swaggerize` (and `yo` if you haven't already):


  ```bash

  $ npm install -g yo

  $ npm install -g generator-swaggerize

  ```


  Now run the generator.


  ```bash

  $ mkdir petstore && cd $_

  $ yo swaggerize

  ```


  Follow the prompts (note: make sure to choose `hapi` as your framework choice).


  You now have a working api and can use something like [SwaggerHub](https://swaggerhub.com/?_ga=2.118604234.2143392684.1515431456-1673703125.1481054263) to explore it.


  ### Manual Usage


  ```javascript

  const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');


  const server = new Hapi.Server();


  await server.register({
      plugin: require('hapi-openapi'),
      options: {
          api: Path.join(__dirname, './config/pets.json'),
          handlers: Path.join(__dirname, './handlers')
      }
  });

  ```


  ### Hapi Plugin


  The plugin will be registered as `openapi` on `server.plugins` with the following exposed:


  - `getApi()` - the resolved Swagger document.

  - `setHost(host)` - a helper function for setting the `host` property on the `api`.


  ### Configuration Options


  - `api` - a path to a valid OpenAPI 2.0 document, or a valid document in the form of an object.

  - *deprecated* `docspath` - the path to expose api docs for swagger-ui, etc. Defaults to `/api-docs`.

  - `docs` - an object used to configure the api docs route.
      - `path` - the path to expose api docs for swagger-ui, etc. Defaults to `/api-docs`.
      - `auth` - options auth config for this route.
      - `stripExtensions` - strip vendor extensions from docs. Defaults to true.
      - `prefixBasePath` - prefix path of docs with he OpenAPI document's `basePath` value. Defaults to true.
  - `handlers` - either a string directory structure for route handlers, object, or not set if using `x-hapi-handler`.

  - `extensions` - an array of file extension types to use when scanning for handlers. Defaults to `['js']`.

  - `vhost` - *optional* domain string (see [hapi route options](http://hapijs.com/api#route-options)).

  - `cors` - *optional* cors setting (see [hapi route options](http://hapijs.com/api#route-options)).

  - `outputvalidation` - *optional* validate response data.


  ### Mount Path


  Api `path` values will be prefixed with the OpenAPI document's `basePath` value.  This behavior can be negated if you set the option `docs.prefixBasePath` to `false`.


  ### Handlers Directory


  The `options.handlers` option specifies a directory to scan for handlers. These handlers are bound to the api `paths` defined in the OpenAPI document.


  ```

  handlers
    |--foo
    |    |--bar.js
    |--foo.js
    |--baz.js
  ```


  Will route as:


  ```

  foo.js => /foo

  foo/bar.js => /foo/bar

  baz.js => /baz

  ```


  ### Path Parameters


  The file and directory names in the handlers directory can also represent path parameters.


  For example, to represent the path `/users/{id}`:


  ```shell

  handlers
    |--users
    |    |--{id}.js
  ```


  This works with directory names as well:


  ```shell

  handlers
    |--users
    |    |--{id}.js
    |    |--{id}
    |        |--foo.js
  ```


  To represent `/users/{id}/foo`.


  ### Handlers File


  Each provided javascript file should export an object containing functions with HTTP verbs as keys.


  Example:


  ```javascript

  module.exports = {
      get: function (req, h) { ... },
      put: function (req, h) { ... },
      ...
  }

  ```


  Optionally, `pre` handlers can be used by providing an array of handlers for a method:


  ```javascript

  module.exports = {
      get: [
          function p1(req, h) { ... },
          function handler(req, h) { ... }
      ],
  }

  ```


  ### Handlers Object


  The directory generation will yield this object, but it can be provided directly as `options.handlers`.


  Example:


  ```javascript

  {
      'foo': {
          'get': function (req, h) { ... },
          'bar': {
              'get': function (req, h) { ... },
              'post': function (req, h) { ... }
          }
      }
      ...
  }

  ```


  ### X-Hapi-Handler


  Alternatively the API document can set `x-hapi-handler` attribute on each defined `paths` element if `handlers` is not defined.


  Example:


  ```

  "/pets/{id}": {
      "x-hapi-handler": "./routes/pets-by-id.js",
      .
      .
      .
  ```


  This will construct a `handlers` object from the given `x-hapi-handler` files.


  ### X-Hapi-Options


  There is now support at the operations level for `x-hapi-options` which represent individual [Hapi Route Optijons](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#route-options).


  This support is limited to configuration supported by the JSON file type.


  Example:


  ```

  "/internal": {
    "post": {
      "x-hapi-options": {
        "isInternal": true
      }
      .
      .
      .
  ```


  ### Authentication


  Support for OpenAPI [security schemes](http://swagger.io/specification/#securitySchemeObject) requires that relevant authentication scheme and strategy are registered before the hapi-openapi plugin. See the [hapi docs](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/auth) for information about authentication schemes and strategies.


  The name of the hapi authentication strategy is expected to match the name field of the OpenAPI [security requirement object](http://swagger.io/specification/#securityRequirementObject).


  Example:


  ```yaml

  securityDefinitions:
    api_key:
      type: apiKey
      name: Authorization
      in: header
  paths:
    '/users/':
      get:
        security:
          - api_key: []
  ```


  ```javascript

  const server = new Hapi.Server();


  await server.register({ plugin: AuthTokenScheme });


  server.auth.strategy('api_key', 'auth-token-scheme', {
      validateFunc: async function (token) {
        // Implement validation here, return { credentials, artifacts }.
      }
  });


  await server.register({
      plugin: require('hapi-openapi'),
      options: {
          api: require('./config/pets.json'),
          handlers: Path.join(__dirname, './handlers')
      }
  });

  ```


  ### X-Hapi-Auth


  Alternatively it may be easier to automatically register a plugin to handle registering the necessary schemes and strategies.


  **x-hapi-auth-schemes**


  The root document can contain an `x-hapi-auth-schemes` object specifying different plugins responsible for registering auth schemes.


  Example:


  ```

  "x-hapi-auth-schemes": {
      "apiKey": "../lib/xauth-scheme.js"
  }

  ```


  This plugin will be passed the following options:


  - `name` - the auth scheme name, in this example `apiKey`.


  **x-hapi-auth-strategy**


  The `securityDefinitions` entries can contain an `x-hapi-auth-strategy` attribute pointing to a plugin responsible for registering auth strategies.


  Example:


  ```

  "securityDefinitions": {
    "api_key": {
      "x-hapi-auth-strategy": "../lib/xauth-strategy.js",
      "type": "apiKey",
      "name": "authorization",
      "in": "header"
    }
  }

  ```


  The plugin will be passed the following options:


  - `name` - the `securityDefinitions` entry's key. In this example, `api_key`. This is typically used as the strategy name.

  - `scheme` - the `securityDefinitions` `type`. In this example, `apiKey`. This should match a `x-hapi-auth-scheme` name.

  - `where` - `securityDefinitions` entry `in` attribute. This is search for the `lookup` value; in this example `header`.

  - `lookup` - `securityDefinitions` entry `name` attribute. Used as the name to look up against `where`.


  The way you can make these play together is that for every `type`, a scheme exists that delegates some lookup or evaluation to the appropriate strategy.


  Example:


  ```javascript

  //xauth-scheme.js


  const register = function (server, { name  }) {
      server.auth.scheme(name /*apiKey*/, (server, /* options received from the strategy */ { validate }) => {
          return {
              authenticate: async function (request, h) {
                  return h.authenticated(await validate(request));
              }
          };
      });
  };


  module.exports = { register, name: 'x-hapi-auth-scheme' };

  ```


  and


  ```javascript

  //xauth-strategy.js


  const Boom = require('@hapi/boom');


  const register = function (server, { name, scheme, where, lookup }) {
      server.auth.strategy(name, /* the scheme to use this strategy with */ scheme, {
          //Define a validate function for the scheme above to receive
          validate: async function (request) {
              const token = request.headers[lookup];

              //Some arbitrary example
              if (token === '12345') {
                  return { credentials: { scope: ['read'] }, artifacts: { token } };
              }

              throw Boom.unauthorized();
          }
      });
  };


  module.exports = { register, name: 'x-hapi-auth-strategy' };

  ```

  A python client for [Swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) enabled REST API. It wouldn't be easier to

  try Swagger REST API by [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui). However, when it's time to **unittest**

  your API, the first option you find would be [Swagger-codegen](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen), but the better option is us.


  This project is developed after [swagger-py](https://github.com/digium/swagger-py), which is a nicely implemented one, and inspired many aspects of this project. Another project is [flex](https://github.com/pipermerriam/flex), which focuses on parameter validation, try it if you can handle other parts by yourselves. For other projects related to Swagger tools in python, check [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec#python).


  **pyswagger** is much easier to use (compared to swagger-codegen, you don't need to prepare a scala environment) and tries hard to **fully supports** [Swagger Spec](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) in all aspects.

  ## Quick Start


  Before running this script, please make sure [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) is installed on your environment.


  ```python

  from pyswagger import App, Security

  from pyswagger.contrib.client.requests import Client

  from pyswagger.utils import jp_compose


  # load Swagger resource file into App object

  app = App._create_('http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json')


  auth = Security(app)

  auth.update_with('api_key', '12312312312312312313q') # api key

  auth.update_with('petstore_auth', '12334546556521123fsfss') # oauth2


  # init swagger client

  client = Client(auth)


  # a dict is enough for representing a Model in Swagger

  pet_Tom=dict(id=1, name='Tom', photoUrls=['http://test']) 

  # a request to create a new pet

  client.request(app.op['addPet'](body=pet_Tom))


  # - access an Operation object via App.op when operationId is defined

  # - a request to get the pet back

  req, resp = app.op['getPetById'](petId=1)

  # prefer json as response

  req.produce('application/json')

  pet = client.request((req, resp)).data

  assert pet.id == 1

  assert pet.name == 'Tom'


  # new ways to get Operation object corresponding to 'getPetById'.

  # 'jp_compose' stands for JSON-Pointer composition

  req, resp = app.resolve(jp_compose('/pet/{petId}', base='#/paths')).get(petId=1)

  req.produce('application/json')

  pet = client.request((req, resp)).data

  assert pet.id == 1

  ```


  ---------


  ## Installation

  We support pip installtion.

  ```bash

  pip install pyswagger

  ```


  Additional dependencies must be prepared before firing a request. If you are going to access a remote/local web server, you must install [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) first.

  ```bash

  pip install requests

  ```


  If you want to test a local tornado server, please make sure tornado is ready on your environment

  ``` bash

  pip install tornado

  ```


  We also provide native client for flask app, but to use it, flask is also required

  ``` bash

  pip install flask

  ```

  == Overview



  NOTE: Dear community,

  unfortunately I can't maintain Swagger2Markup alone anymore. There are many interesting new topics:

  1) Swagger v3 support

  2) Fixing bugs

  2) Merge Swagger2Markup repositories and create a new multi-module repository.

  Any help is welcome.

  Kind regards,

  Robert



  The primary goal of this project is to *simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that's been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation* produced by https://github.com/swagger-api[Swagger]. The result is intended to be an *up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide*, comparable to https://developer.github.com/v3/[GitHub's API documentation]. The output of Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[swagger-ui] and can be served as static content.

  NOTE: The Swagger Specification has been donated to to the https://openapis.org/[Open API Initiative (OAI)] and has been renamed to the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI Specification].


  Swagger2Markup converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several *AsciiDoc* or *GitHub Flavored Markdown* documents which can be combined with hand-written documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. Swagger2Markup supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification. Internally it uses the _official_ https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser[swagger-parser] and my https://github.com/RobWin/markup-document-builder[markup-document-builder].


  You can use Swagger2Markup to convert your contract-first Swagger YAML file into a human-readable format and combine it with hand-written documentation. As an alternative, you can choose the code-first approach and use Swagger2Markup together with https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-Core-JAX-RS-Project-Setup-1.5.X[Swagger JAX-RS], https://github.com/springfox/springfox[springfox] or https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs[spring-restdocs]. If you are Gradle or Maven user, you can also use the https://github.com/RobWin/swagger2markup-gradle-plugin[Swagger2Markup Gradle Plugin] or https://github.com/redowl/swagger2markup-maven-plugin[Swagger2markup Maven Plugin].


  http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] is preferable to Markdown as it has more features. AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be converted to *HTML*, *PDF* and *EPUB*. AsciiDoc is much better suited for describing public APIs than *JavaDoc* or *Annotations*.


  You can generate your HTML5, PDF and EPUB documentation via https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[asciidoctorj] or even better via the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin[asciidoctor-gradle-plugin] or https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin[asciidoctor-maven-plugin].


  The project requires at least JDK 8.

  # OpenAPI-CodeGen


  [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/Mermade/openapi-codegen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mermade/openapi-codegen)


  Node.js-based codegen for OpenAPI documents. This project was initially a 24-hour hackathon. The local model adaptor code is entirely original and has been reverse-engineered from the existing documentation and template usage.


  **Work in progress**


  Supports OpenAPI 3.0.x natively, and Swagger/OpenAPI 1.2 and 2.0 by internal conversion. Node.js LTS versions are supported.


  ## Usage


  ### Installing


  `npm i -g openapi-codegen`


  or


  * clone the repository, and

  * `npm i`


  or


  `npx -p openapi-codegen cg ...`


  ### CLI


  ```

  cg [options] {[path]configName} {openapi-definition}


  Options:
    --help           Show help                                           [boolean]
    --version        Show version number                                 [boolean]
    --filter         Filter term to use with --list                       [string]
    --list           List available templates for provider (og or sc)     [string]
    -d, --debug      Turn on debugging information in the model          [boolean]
    -f, --flat       Do not include config-name in output directory structure
                                                                         [boolean]
    -l, --lint       Lint input definition                               [boolean]
    -o, --output     Specify output directory         [string] [default: "./out/"]
    -s, --stools     Use swagger-tools to validate OpenAPI 2.0 definitions
                                                                         [boolean]
    -t, --templates  Specify templates directory                          [string]
    -v, --verbose    Increase verbosity                                  [boolean]
    -z, --zip        Create a .zip file instead of individual files      [boolean]
  ```


  e.g.


  ```

  node cg --verbose nodejs defs/generator.yaml

  ```


  In this case, the generated code will be written to the `.out/nodejs` directory.


  You can also load the OpenAPI definition from a URL.


  ### API


  ```javascript

  const renderer = require('openapi-codegen');

  // load a config and a definition

  renderer.main(definition,config,configName);

  ```


  ## Templates


  The local templates were taken directly from `swagger-codegen`. This project is also licensed under [Apache-2.0](LICENSE) for this reason. Generated code is explicitly covered by the [Unlicense](templates/_common/UNLICENSE). Code to downconvert OpenAPI 3.0 definitions is taken from [Angular-Swagger-UI](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/angular-swagger-ui) and is MIT licensed.


  You can also use the latest online templates from two providers: `og` ([openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)) and `sc` ([swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)). The `--list` and `--filter` options allow you to see which templates are available. Note that using the online templates involves sending your API definition to a remote server.


  ### Contributors


  See [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen#template-creator) for a partial list of template contributors.


  ### Status of the template configurations


  The local templates with a status have a working (if not necessarily tested) configuration in the **configs** directory. Contributions are welcomed from the community of new and updated configurations and template updates.

  ## Swurg is a Burp Suite extension designed for OpenAPI testing.

  > The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service. 

  > 

  > Use cases for machine-readable API definition documents include, but are not limited to: interactive documentation; code generation for documentation, clients, and servers; and automation of test cases. OpenAPI documents describe an API's services and are represented in either YAML or JSON formats. These documents may either be produced and served statically or be generated dynamically from an application.

  > 

  > \- [OpenAPI Initiative](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)


  Performing security assessment of OpenAPI-based APIs can be a tedious task due to Burp Suite (industry standard) lacking native OpenAPI parsing capabilities. A solution to this situation, is to use third-party tools (e.g. `SOAP-UI`) or to implement custom scripts (often on a per engagement basis) to handle the parsing of OpenAPI documents and integrate/chain the results to Burp Suite to use its first class scanning capabilities.


  Swurg is an OpenAPI parser that aims to streamline this entire process by allowing security professionals to use Burp Suite as a standalone tool for security assessment of OpenAPI-based APIs.


  ## Supported Features

  * Parse OpenAPI documents, formerly known as the `Swagger specification`, fully compliant with OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 Specifications (OAS). Supports both JSON and YAML formats.

  * OpenAPI documents can be parsed either from a supplied file or URL. The extension can fetch OpenAPI documents directly from a URL using the `Send to Swagger Parser` feature under the `Target -> Site map` context menu.

  * Requests can be sent to the `Comparer, Intruder, Repeater, Scanner and Site map` Burp tools.


  ## Installation

  ### Compilation 

  #### Windows & Linux

  1. Install gradle (<https://gradle.org/>)

  2. Download the repository.

  ```console

  $ git clone https://github.com/AresS31/swurg

  $ cd .\swurg\

  ```

  3. Create the swurg jarfile:

  ```console

  $ gradle fatJar

  ```


  ### Burp Suite settings

  In Burp Suite, under the `Extender/Options` tab, click on the `Add` button and load the `swurg-all` jarfile. 


  ## Possible Improvements

  - [ ] Beautify the graphical user interface.

  - [ ] Enable cells editing to change API calls directly from the GUI.

  - [x] Further optimise the source code.

  - [ ] Implement support for authenticated testing (via user-supplied API-keys).

  - [ ] Improve the Param column by adding the type of parameters (e.g. inquery, inbody, etc.).

  - [ ] Increase the extension verbosity (via the bottom panel).


  ## Dependencies

  ### Third-party libraries

  #### Swagger Parser:

  The [Swagger Parser](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.swagger.parser.v3/swagger-parser) library is required and automatically imported in this project.


  ## Project information

  In July 2016, after posting a request for improvement on the [PortSwigger support forum](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/questions/16358278-swagger-parser-and-wsdler-improvement), I decided to take the initiative and to implement a solution myself.


  The extension is still in development, feedback, comments and contributions are therefore much appreciated.

fmvilas/openapi3-generator: >
  <h1 align="center">OpenAPI 3 Generator</h1>

  <p align="center">
    Use your API OpenAPI 3 definition to generate code, documentation, and literally anything you need.
  </p>


  ## Install


  To use it from the CLI:


  ```bash

  npm install -g openapi3-generator

  ```


  ## Requirements


  * Node.js v7.6+


  ## Usage


  ### From the command-line interface (CLI)


  ```bash
    Usage: og [options] <openapiFileOrURL> <template>


    Options:

      -V, --version                  output the version number
      -o, --output <outputDir>       directory where to put the generated files (defaults to current directory)
      -t, --templates <templateDir>  directory where templates are located (defaults to internal templates directory)
      -b, --basedir <baseDir>        directory to use as the base when resolving local file references (defaults to OpenAPI file directory)
      -h, --help                     output usage information
  ```


  #### Examples


  The shortest possible syntax:

  ```bash

  og openapi.yaml markdown

  ```


  Specify where to put the generated code:

  ```bash

  og -o ./my-docs openapi.yaml markdown

  ```


  ## Templates


  ### Creating your own templates

  Templates are the sources where the result will be generated from. There are already some templates

  you can use to generate code and documentation.


  The files in your template can be of the following types:

  1. Static: This kind of files will be simply copied to the output directory.

  2. Templates: This kind of files will be compiled using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), and copied to the output directory.

  3. Path templates: This kind of files will be compiled using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), but it will generate one file per OpenAPI path.


  Assuming we have the following OpenAPI Spec:

  ```yaml

  openapi: "3.0.0"

  info:
    version: 1.0.0
    title: OpenAPI Petstore
    license:
      name: MIT
  servers:
    - url: http://petstore.openapi.io/v1
  paths:
    /pet:
      get:...
      post:...
    /pet/{petId}:
      get:...
    /user/login:
      post:...
    /user/{username}:
      get:...
      put:...
      delete:...
  ...

  ```

  And some template files like this:

  ```

  |- index.js            // This file contains static code, e.g. starting a webserver and including ./api/index.js

  |+ api/
   |- index.js.hbs       // This is a static template, it contains placeholders that will be filled in, e.g. includes for each file in routes
   |+ routes/
    |- $$path$$.route.js.hbs      // This file will be generated for each operation and contains skeleton code for each method for an operation.
    |+ $$path$$/                  // This folder will also be generated for each operation.
      |- route.js.hbs             // This is another example of an operation file.
  ```

  The first important thing to notice here is the variable notation in `$$path$$.route.js.hbs`. It will be replaced by the name of the path.


  This example also shows `$$path$$` used in a folder name - the generated folder names here will replace $$path$$ with

  the name of the path (in kebab-case).


  In this example the generated directory structure will be like this:

  ```

  |- index.js            // This file still contains static code like before.

  |+ api/
   |- index.js           // This file will now e.g. have included the two files in routes.
   |+ routes/
    |- pet.route.js      // This file contains the code for methods on pets.
    |                    // (e.g. getPet, postPet, getPetByPetId).
    |- user.route.js     // This file will contain the code for methods on users.
    |                    // (e.g. postUserLogin, getUserByUsername, putUserByUsername, deleteUserByUsername).
    |+ pet/
     | - route.js        // this file also contains the code for methods on pets.
    |+ user/
     | - route.js        // this file also contains the code for methods on users.
  ```


  ### Template file extensions

  You can (optionally) name your template files with `.hbs` extensions, which will be removed when writing the generated

  file. e.g. `index.js.hbs` writes `index.js`. `index.js` would also write to `index.js`, if you prefer to omit the hbs

  extension.


  The only case where the `.hbs` extension isn't optional would be if you are writing handlebars templates with the

  templates. In that case the the template would need the extension `.hbs.hbs`. `usertpl.hbs.hbs` writes `usertpl.hbs`

  (but `usertpl.hbs` as a source would write `usertpl` with no extension).


  ### Template file content

  The generator passes the OpenAPI spec to template files, so all information should be available there.

  In addition to that, the code generator adds a bit [more data](#data-passed-to-handlebars-templates) that can be helpful.


  #### Examples:

  ##### Dynamically require files in JavaScript

  ```mustache

  {{#each @root.openapi.endpoints}}

  const {{.}} = require('./routes/{{.}}.route.js')

  {{/each}}

  ```

  will produce (using the OAS Spec example from above):

  ```js

  const pet = require('./routes/pet.route.js')

  const user = require('./routes/user.route.js')

  ```


  ### Data passed to Handlebars templates

  | Param | Type | Description |

  | --- | --- | --- |

  |openapi|object|The OpenAPI spec.|

  |openapi.endpoints| object | All first level endpoints (e.g  `pet` and `user`) |


  ### Custom handlebars helpers

  If your template needs Handlebars helpers, you can define them in a directory called `.helpers` inside your template.


  Check out some examples in the [markdown](./templates/markdown/.helpers) template.


  ### Using handlebars partials

  If you want to use partials in your template, define them in a directory called `.partials` inside your template.


  Check out some examples in the [markdown](./templates/markdown/.partials) template.


  > The name of the partial will be obtained from the file name, converted to camel case. So, for instance, if the file name is `my-partial.js`, you can use the partial with `{{> myPartial}}`.

  # Convert OData to OpenAPI.NET [Preview]


  [**Disclaimer:This library is in a preview state. Feedback and contribution is welcome!**]


  ## Introduction


  The **Microsoft.OpenAPI.OData.Reader** library helps represent an OData service metadata as an OpenApi description. It converts [OData](http://www.odata.org) [CSDL](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-csdl-xml/v4.01/odata-csdl-xml-v4.01.html), the XML representation of the Entity Data Model (EDM) describing an OData service into [Open API](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) based on [OpenAPI.NET](http://aka.ms/openapi) object model.


  The conversion is based on the mapping doc from [OASIS OData OpenAPI v1.0](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=61852&wg_abbrev=odata) and uses the following :


  1. [Capabilities vocabulary annotation](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.xml)

  2. [Authorization vocabulary annotation](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Authorization.V1.xml)

  3. [Core vocabulary annotation](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.xml)

  4. Navigation property path

  5. Edm operation and operation import path


  ## Overview


  The image below is generic overview of how this library can convert the EDM model to an [OpenAPI.NET document](https://github.com/Microsoft/OpenAPI.NET/blob/master/src/Microsoft.OpenApi/Models/OpenApiDocument.cs) object.


  ![Convert OData CSDL to OpenAPI](docs/images/odata-2-openapi.png "Map /// OData CSDL --> OpenAPI.NET")


  For more information on the CSDL and Entity Data model, please refer to [http://www.odata.org/documentation](http://www.odata.org/documentation).

  For more information about the Open API object of model, please refer to [http://github.com/microsoft/OpenAPI.NET](http://github.com/microsoft/OpenAPI.NET)


  ## Sample code


  The following sample code illustrates the use of the library


  ```csharp

  public static void GenerateOpenApiDescription()

  {
      IEdmModel model = GetEdmModel();
      OpenApiDocument document = model.ConvertToOpenApi();
      var outputJSON = document.SerializeAsJson(OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi3_0);
      var outputYAML = document.SerializeAsYaml(OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi3_0);
  }


  public static IEdmModel GetEdmModel()

  {
      // load EDM model here...
  }

  ```


  Or with the convert settings:


  ```csharp

  public static void GenerateOpenApiDescription()

  {
      IEdmModel model = GetEdmModel();
      OpenApiConvertSettings settings = new OpenApiConvertSettings
      {
          // configuration
      };
      OpenApiDocument document = model.ConvertToOpenApi(settings);
      var outputJSON = document.SerializeAsJson(OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi3_0);
      var outputYAML = document.SerializeAsYaml(OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi3_0);
  }


  public static IEdmModel GetEdmModel()

  {
      // load EDM model here...
  }

  ```


  The `GetEdmModel()` method can load a model in 3 ways:


  1. Create the Edm model from scratch. For details refer [building a basic model](http://odata.github.io/odata.net/#02-01-build-basic-model)


  2. Load the Edm model from CSDL file. The following shows a code sample that loads a model from a csdl file.

      ```csharp
      public static IEdmModel GetEdmModel()
      {
          string csdlFilePath = @"c:\csdl.xml";
          string csdl = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(csdlFilePath);
          IEdmModel model = CsdlReader.Parse(XElement.Parse(csdl).CreateReader());
          return model;
      }
      ```

  3. Create the Edm model using Web API OData model builder. For details refer to the [web api model builder article](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/#02-01-model-builder-abstract)


  ## Nightly builds


  The nightly build process will upload a Nuget package for OpenAPI.OData.reader to [OpenAPIOData MyGet gallery](https://www.myget.org/gallery/openapiodata).


  To connect to OpenAPI.OData.reader feed, use [this](https://www.myget.org/F/openapiodata/api/v3/index.json) URL source.


  ## Nuget packages


  The OpenAPI.OData.reader nuget package is at: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OpenApi.OData/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OpenApi.OData)

  ## Quickstart


  Initialize a new OAS Tools project from the CLI


  ```sh

  > npx @oas-tools/cli init

  ```


  It will prompt the following menu, asking which type of resource will be initialized:


  ```sh

  ? Select a resource to initialize (Use arrow keys)

  > Server
    Module
    Development environment
    OpenAPI File
  ```

  Select `server`, answer the questions and you'll get a running server with OAS Tools.

  This module provides NodeJS RESTfull APIs scaffolding based OpenAPI 3.x specs using [oas-tools](https://github.com/isa-group/oas-tools) and [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express). It is compatible with servers generated with the swagger-tool suite to help in the transition from pre-existing servers based on 2.x specs.


  We have a 2 min. tutorial:


  <a href="https://youtu.be/OZhtoXP2Gi4" alt="oas-generator introduction (v2.0.6) - Click to Watch!"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fcqaWCq.jpg" align="center" width="300" alt="oas-generator introduction (v2.0.6) - Click to Watch!"></a>



  ## 1\. Install oas-generator


  ```bash

  npm install oas-generator -g

  ```


  ## 2\. Use oas-generator command


  ### 2.1\. Help


  ```bash

  $ oas-generator --help


  Usage:  oas-generator <OAS v3 file in YAML or JSON>

    Options:

      -n, --projectName <projectName>  Name for the generated folder
      -z, --generateZip                Indicate whether the generated folder must be deleted after compression
      -h, --help                       output usage information
  ```


  ### 2.2 Examples


  Generate a NodeJS project: The following command wil create the code of a NodeJS application based on the OpenAPI Spec 3.x `docker-engine.yaml` and place its code in a folder by the name `generatedServer`.


  ```bash

  $ oas-generator specs/docker-engine.yaml -n generatedServer

  ```


  Once the folder is created locate into it. Install dependencies and run it by doing npm start:


  ```bash

  $ cd generatedServer

  $ npm start

  ```


  Now your app is running on port 8080.

  You can try the url [http://localhost:8080/v1.33/volumes](http://localhost:8080/v1.33/volumes)


  In the folder `controllers` there will be a set of js files with the templates for each method specified in the spec that should be completed to have a fully working API.


  Happy coding!

  ## Installation


  ```

  pip install aio-openapi

  ```


  ## Development


  Clone the repository and create a virtual environment `venv`.


  Install dependencies by running the install script


  ```

  ./dev/install

  ```


  To run tests


  ```

  pytest --cov

  ```


  ## Features


  - Asynchronous web routes with [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

  - Data validation, serialization and unserialization with python [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)

  - [OpenApi][] v 3 auto documentation

  - [SqlAlchemy][] expression language

  - Asynchronous DB interaction with [asyncpg][]

  - Migrations with [alembic][]

  - SqlAlchemy tables as python dataclasses

  - Support [click][] command line interface

  - Optional [sentry](https://sentry.io) middleware


  ## Web App


  To create an openapi RESTful application follow this schema (lets call the file `main.py`)


  ```python

  from openapi.rest import rest


  def create_app():
      return rest(
          openapi=dict(
              title='A REST API',
              ...
          ),
          base_path='/v1',
          allowed_tags=[...],
          validate_docs=True,
          setup_app=setup_app,
          commands=[...]
      )


  def setup_app(app):
      app.router.add_routes(...)
      return app


  if __name__ == '__main__':
      create_app().main()
  ```


  The `create_app` function creates the [aiohttp][] server application by invoking the `rest` function.

  This function adds the [click][] command in the `cli` mapping entry and add

  documentation for routes which support OpenAPI docs.

  The `setup_app` function is used to actually setup the custom application, usually by adding middleware, routes,

  shutdown callbacks, database integration and so forth.


  ## OpenAPI Documentation


  The library provide tools for creating OpenAPI v 3 compliant endpoints and

  auto-document them.


  An example from test `tests/example` directory


  ```python

  from typing import List


  from aiohttp import web


  from openapi.db.path import SqlApiPath

  from openapi.spec import op



  routes = web.RouteTableDef()



  @routes.view('/tasks')

  class TasksPath(SqlApiPath):
      """
      ---
      summary: Create and query Tasks
      tags:
          - name: Task
            description: Task tag description
      """
      table = 'tasks'

      @op(query_schema=TaskOrderableQuery, response_schema=List[Task])
      async def get(self) -> web.Response:
          """
          ---
          summary: Retrieve Tasks
          description: Retrieve a list of Tasks
          responses:
              200:
                  description: Authenticated tasks
          """
          paginated = await self.get_list()
          return paginated.json_response()

      @op(response_schema=Task, body_schema=TaskAdd)
      async def post(self) -> web.Response:
          """
          ---
          summary: Create a Task
          description: Create a new Task
          responses:
              201:
                  description: the task was successfully added
              422:
                  description: Failed validation
          """
          data = await self.create_one()
          return self.json_response(data, status=201)
  ```


  ## Database Integration


  This library provides integration with [asyncpg][], an high performant asynchronous

  connector with [PostgreSql][] database.

  To add the database extension simply use the `get_db` function in the applicatiuon `setup_app` function:


  ```python

  from aiohttp import web


  from openapi.db import get_db


  def setup_app(app: web.Application) -> None:
      db = get_db(app)
      meta = db.metadata

  ```


  This will enable database connection and command line tools (most of them from [alembic][]):


  ```

  python main.py db --help

  ```


  The database container is available at the `db` app key:


  ```python

  app['db']

  ```


  ## Websockets


  This library provides a simple distributed websocket utility for creating

  websocket remote procedure calls (RPC) and pub/sub.


  ```python

  from aiohttp import web


  from openapi.ws import Sockets


  app = web.Application()

  ...

  app['web_sockets'] = Sockets(app)

  ```


  ### RPC protocol


  The RPC protocol has the following structure for incoming messages


  ```javascript

  {
      "id": "abc",
      "method": "rpc_method_name",
      "payload": {
          ...
      }
  }

  ```


  The `id` is used by clients to link the request with the corresponding response.

  The response for an RPC call is eitrher a success


  ```javascript

  {
      "id": "abc",
      "method": "rpc_method_name",
      "response": {
          ...
      }
  }

  ```


  or error


  ```

  {
      "id": "abc",
      "method": "rpc_method_name":
      "error": {
          ...
      }
  }

  ```


  ### Publish/Subscribe


  To subscribe to messages, one need to use the `Subscribe` mixin with the subscribe RPC handler.

  Messages take the form:


  ```javascript

  {
      "channel": "channel_name",
      "event": "event_name",
      "data": {
          ...
      }
  }

  ```


  ## Environment Variables


  Several environment variables are used by the library to support testing and deployment.


  - `DATASTORE`: PostgreSql connection string (same as [SqlAlchemy][] syntax)

  - `DBPOOL_MIN_SIZE`: minimum size of database connection pool (default is 10)

  - `DBPOOL_MAX_SIZE`: maximum size of database connection pool (default is 10)

  ## Peace of Mind


  The reason this package exists is to give you peace of mind when providing a RESTful API. Instead of chasing down preventable bugs and saying sorry to consumers, you can focus on more important things in life.


  - Your **API documentation is never out-of-date**, since it is generated out of the API document that you write.

  - The documentation comes with **_try-it-out_ examples** for every endpoint in your API. You don't have to provide (and maintain) `curl` commands to showcase how your API works. Users can try it themselves, right in their browsers.

  - Your **API document is always valid**, since your Pyramid app won't even start if the document is not according to OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

  - Automatic request **payload validation and sanitization**. Your views do not require any code for validation and input sanitation. Your view code only deals with business logic. Tons of tests never need to be written since every request, and its payload, is validated against your API document before it reaches your view code.

  - Your API **responses always match your API document**. Every response from your view is validated against your document and a `500 Internal Server Error` is returned if the response does not exactly match what your document says the output of a certain API endpoint should be. This decreases the effects of the [Hyrum's Law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com).

  - **A single source of truth**. Because of the checks outlined above you can be sure that whatever your API document says is in fact what is going on in reality. You have a single source of truth to consult when asking an API related question, such as "Remind me again, which fields does the endpoint /user/info return?".

  - Based on [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com), a **mature Python Web framework**. Companies such as Mozilla, Yelp, RollBar and SurveyMonkey [trust Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/community-powered-by-pyramid.html), and the new [pypi.org](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse) runs on Pyramid too. Pyramid is thoroughly [tested](https://travis-ci.org/Pylons/pyramid) and [documented](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/), providing flexibility, performance, and a large ecosystem of [high-quality add-ons](https://trypyramid.com/extending-pyramid.html).


  ## Features


  - Validates your API document (for example, `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json`) against the OpenAPI 3.0 specification using the [openapi-spec-validator](https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-spec-validator).

  - Generates and serves the [Swagger try-it-out documentation](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) for your API.

  - Validates incoming requests *and* outgoing responses against your API document using [openapi-core](https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-core).



  ## Getting started


  1. Declare `pyramid_openapi3` as a dependency in your Pyramid project.


  2. Include the following lines:


  ```python

  config.include("pyramid_openapi3")

  config.pyramid_openapi3_spec('openapi.yaml', route='/api/v1/openapi.yaml')

  config.pyramid_openapi3_add_explorer(route='/api/v1/')

  ```


  3. Use the `openapi` [view predicate](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/viewconfig.html#view-configuration-parameters) to enable request/response validation:


  ```python

  @view_config(route_name="foobar", openapi=True, renderer='json')

  def myview(request):
      return request.openapi_validated.parameters
  ```


  For requests, `request.openapi_validated` is available with two fields: `parameters` and `body`.

  For responses, if the payload does not match the API document, an exception is raised.



  ## Demo / Examples


  There are two examples provided with this package:

  * A fairly simple [single-file app providing a Hello World API](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_openapi3/tree/master/examples/singlefile).

  * A slightly more [built-out app providing a TODO app API](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_openapi3/tree/master/examples/todoapp).


  Both examples come with tests that exhibit pyramid_openapi's error handling and validation capabilities.


  A **fully built-out app**, with 100% test coverage, providing a [RealWorld.io](https://realworld.io) API is available at [niteoweb/pyramid-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/niteoweb/pyramid-realworld-example-app). It is a Heroku-deployable Pyramid app that provides an API for a Medium.com-like social app. You are encouraged to use it as a scaffold for your next project.



  ## Design defense


  The authors of pyramid_openapi3 believe that the approach of validating a manually-written API document is superior to the approach of generating the API document from Python code. Here are the reasons:


  a) Both generation and validation against a document are lossy processes. The underlying libraries running the generation/validation will always have something missing. Either a feature from the latest OpenAPI specification, or an implementation bug. Having to fork the underlying library in order to generate the part of your API document that might only be needed for the frontend is unfortunate.

     Validation on the other hand allows one to skip parts of validation that are not supported yet, and not block a team from shipping the document.

  b) Validation approach does sacrifice DRY-ness, one has to write the API document and then the (view) code in Pyramid. Feels a bit redundant at first. However, this provides a clear separation between the intent and the implementation.


  c) Generation approach has the drawback of having to write Python code even for parts of the API document that the Pyramid backend does not handle, as it might be handled by a different system, or be specific only to documentation or only to the client side of the API. This bloats your Pyramid codebase with code that does not belong there.


  ## Running tests


  You need to have [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/) and Python 3.7 or 3.8 installed on your machine. Then you can run:

      $ make tests

  ## Related packages


  These packages tackle the same problem-space:


  - [pyramid_oas3](https://github.com/kazuki/pyramid-oas3) seems to do things very similarly to pyramid_openapi3, but the documentation is not in English and we sadly can't fully understand what it does just reading the code.

  - [pyramid_swagger](https://github.com/striglia/pyramid_swagger) does a similar
    thing, but for Swagger 2.0 documents.
  - [connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) takes the same "write spec first, code second" approach as pyramid_openapi3, but is based on Flask.

  - [bottle-swagger](https://github.com/ampedandwired/bottle-swagger) takes the same "write spec first, code second" approach too, but is based on Bottle.

  - [pyramid_apispec](https://github.com/ergo/pyramid_apispec) uses generation with
    help of apispec and marshmallow validation library. See above [why we prefer validation instead of generation](#design-defense).

  ## Deprecation policy


  We do our best to follow the rules below.


  * Support the latest two releases of Python, currently Python 3.7 and 3.8.

  * Support only a single release of `openapi-core` and its sub-dependencies. See `Pipfile.lock` for a frozen-in-time known-good-set of all dependencies.


  ## Use in the wild


  A couple of projects that use pyramid_openapi3 in production:


  - [WooCart API](https://app.woocart.com/api/v1/) - User control panel for WooCart Managed WooCommerce service.

  - [Kafkai API](https://app.kafkai.com/api/v1) - User control panel for Kafkai text generation service.

  # Open API F# Parser


  Simple library for parsing YAML/JSON Open API (previously called as Swagger) specification (version 3.0.1). Originally part of my type provider, but I will probably never finish it, so at least community can use part of it for own projects. :)


  ## Installation

  First install NuGet package

      Install-Package OpenAPIParser

  or using [Paket](http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/getting-started.html)

      nuget OpenAPIParser

  ## How to use


  Typically, you would use some existing specification (see [official examples for version 3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/master/examples/v3.0)):


  ```fsharp

  open OpenAPIParser.Version3.Parser

  let openAPI = Document.loadFromYamlFile "mySpec.yaml" 

  ```


  Then you have basic F# record filled


  ```fsharp

  let version = openAPI.Info.Version

  let title = openAPI.Info.Title

  let paths = openAPI.Paths

  ...

  ```


  Please check [test project](https://github.com/Dzoukr/OpenAPIParser/tree/master/tests/OpenAPIParser.Tests) for more examples.


  ## Limitations


  Not all properties from [3.0.1 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md) are implemented. Especially `anyOf` and `oneOf` Schema objects, which will be probably implemented in future versions. Please check [Specification record definition](https://github.com/Dzoukr/OpenAPIParser/blob/master/src/OpenAPIParser/Version3/Specification.fs) for already implemented properties.

  > Generate an organized multi-file OpenAPI repository.


  <center>


  <img src="./logo.png" width="500px"/>


  </center>


  ## Who?

  You! Hello.  Do you need to write or contribute to an OpenAPI definition?  If so, read on...


  ## What?

  We recommend a docs-like-code approach to OpenAPI definitions:

  - Write it using your favorite text-editor or IDE (we love VSCode).

  - Organize it into multiple files and folders to make it easy to navigate.

  - Store it using source control (such as GitHub).

  - Continuously validate it using our free [openapi-cli tool](https://github.com/redocly/openapi-cli) or our free continuous validation service (coming soon).

  - Bundle it (for a smaller footprint to use in other tools or for tools that do not support a multi-file format).


  ## Why?

  There are a few advantages in hosting your API definition on GitHub:
   - Community engagement (PR's and issues -- if you have a public repo)
   - Advertisment in the GitHub community
   - Hosting on GitHub pages (perfect uptime, CDN, Jekyll, custom domains with CNAME)
   - Revision history, branching, CI
   - Review and approval workflows using Pull Requests
   - Fast on-boarding time (developers and tech writers know how to use GitHub :smile:)
   - Fully compatible with Redocly API Reference too

   There are also some advantages to a multi-file YAML format OpenAPI definition:
   - Reuse schema objects to keep things DRY (don't repeat yourself) 
   - Smaller diffs compared to JSON (especially for markdown descriptions)
   - Easier to navigate
   - Easier to edit with confidence

  ## Features

  This generator helps to create a GitHub repo with the following features:
   - Split a big (or small) OpenAPI definition into smaller files organized into folders
   - Bundle it into a single file for deployment
   - Continuous integration/deployment on Travis or Redocly Workflows
   - Code samples as separate files
   - Automate deployment of your OpenAPI definition and docs
   - OpenAPI definition is validated after each commit
   - Live editing in your editor of choice :heart_eyes:

  ## Structure


  You will have a structure similar to this:

  ```
      ├── .redocly.yaml
      ├── LICENSE
      ├── README.md
      ├── docs
      │   ├── favicon.png
      │   └── index.html
      ├── openapi
      │   ├── README.md
      │   ├── code_samples
      │   │   ├── C#
      │   │   │   └── echo
      │   │   │       └── post.cs
      │   │   ├── PHP
      │   │   │   └── echo
      │   │   │       └── post.php
      │   │   └── README.md
      │   ├── components
      │   │   └── README.md
      │   └── paths
      │       └── README.md
      └── package.json
  ```


  However, you can adjust it to any structure you prefer.


  The `openapi` folder is where your OpenAPI definition will live.  Inside there, and the sub-folders, there are `README.md` files to help guide you further. This is also where your entrypoint `openapi.yaml` will live.


  The `components` folder is where you will organize sub-folders such as `schema` to define your schema.


  The `paths` folder is where you will organize your paths. There will be a 'README.md' file in there with suggestions for how to organize it into specially named files (or folders) that use an `@` in place of a `/` (because files cannot have a `/` character in them).  You will also be able to use path parameters by wrapping them in curly braces `{example}`.


  The `.redocly.yaml` file is a universal configuration for various Redocly tools including the lint tool and reference doc engine.


  ## Commands


  The generated repository includes installing a dependency for our `openapi-cli` tool which supports commands such as `validate`, `bundle`, and more.  There are scripted shortcuts defined in the repository's `package.json`.  



  ## Examples of generated repositories

  - https://github.com/Rebilly/RebillyAPI

  - https://github.com/thingful/openapi-spec

  - https://github.com/TwineHealth/TwineDeveloperDocs


  ## How to generate your repository


  We assume you already have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.


  - Install `create-openapi-repo` globally:

  ```bash

  npm install -g create-openapi-repo

  ```

  or use [`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b):


  We'll use `npx` in this example.  However, remove `npx` if you installed it globally.


  ```bash

  npx create-openapi-repo

  ```


  You will be presented with some questions. You can create a new definition or use an existing definition to initialize your project.


  Please note, if you do start a new one, remember to [create a GitHub repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#create-a-new-repository-on-github) where your OpenAPI definition will live.


  If you use the prior version of this generated repository, please read the following upgrade instructions.


  #### Upgrading from a prior version


  Migrate your repository from a previous structure of OpenAPI repo to this newer structure with our migration tool. 


  Run this in the root folder of your repo.


  ```bash

  npx create-openapi-repo --migrate-2-3

  ```


  Note: the migration tool does not migrate plugins automatically. You would need to manually add them to the `transformers` folder. 


  ## Support


  Thank you for wanting to support us. Here are some ideas how to support us:

  Directory of API definitions in [OpenAPI(fka Swagger)](https://openapis.org) [2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md) and [3.x](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md) formats.<BR>

  API access to collection: [Go!][apiDoc-link] - We also have RSS feeds for [added](https://api.apis.guru/v2/added.rss) and [updated](http://api.apis.guru/v2/list.rss) APIs.


  [![Add API][addAPI-image]][addAPI-link]


  Our goal is to create the most comprehensive, standards-compliant and up-to-date directory of machine-readable API definitions, with the following principles:

  - Open source, community driven project.

  - Only publicly available APIs (free or paid).

  - Anyone can add or change an API, not only API owners.

  - All data can be accessed through a [REST API][apiDoc-link].


  If you reference this project and you need an icon or even a banner, check our [branding guide](https://github.com/APIs-guru/branding).


  APIs.guru provide services and consultancy around the GraphQL and OpenAPI specifications and APIs in general.

  What does APIs.guru do?

  --------------------------

  * Filter out private and non-reliable APIs

  * Convert non-OpenAPI formats into OpenAPI 3.x

  * Fix mistakes, ~80% of definitions have some

  * Add additional data, like: logo, categories, …

  * Update definitions on at least a weekly basis


  API definition acceptance criteria

  ----------------------------------

  * Public - anyone can access it as long as they follow some clearly defined steps (subscribe, pay fees, etc.).

  * Persistent - API is made with long-lived goal, and not for a particular event (conference, hackathon, etc.).

  * Useful - API should provide useful functionality not only for its owner.


  Update procedure

  --------------------------

  All definitions are automatically updated from their original source.

  You can see this in the `x-origin` property within each [openapi.yaml](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=x-origin+filename%3Aopenapi.yaml) or [swagger.yaml](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=x-origin+filename%3Aswagger.yaml) file.

  We run our update script at least weekly and automatically revalidate before committing.

  If you see some APIs are not updated for more than 2 weeks please open [an issue](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/issues/new).


  [@seriousme](https://github.com/seriousme) kindly runs a backup validation process based on the official OpenAPI-Specification [JSON Schemas](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/main/schemas) [here](https://github.com/seriousme/openapi-schema-validator/blob/master/test/realworld/failed.md#results-of-real-world-testing).

  ## Quick start


  Download latest binary and run a server.


  ```bash

  # runs a local server on port 8080

  ./openapi-mock serve --specification-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml


  # to test that the server successfully ran

  curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1/pets'

  ```


  Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image.


  ```bash

  # downloads an image

  docker pull muonsoft/openapi-mock


  # runs a docker container with exported port 8080

  docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "OPENAPI_MOCK_SPECIFICATION_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml" --rm muonsoft/openapi-mock


  # to test that the server successfully ran

  curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1/pets'

  ```


  Also, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Example of `docker-compose.yml`


  ```yaml

  version: '3.0'


  services:
    openapi_mock:
      container_name: openapi_mock
      image: muonsoft/openapi-mock
      environment:
        OPENAPI_MOCK_SPECIFICATION_URL: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml'
      ports:
        - "8080:8080"

  # Quick Start



  1. Install the npm module


  ```sh

  # install

  npm i -g sugar-generate

  ```


  2. Create a json schema save, this to **monkey.json**



  ```json

  {
    "name": "monkey",
    "schema": {
      "name": {
        "type": "String",
        "default": ""
      },
      "alive": {
        "type": "Boolean",
        "default": false
      },
      "age": {
        "type": "Number",
        "default": false
      }
    }
  }

  ```


  3. Generate your api and app


  ```sh

  sugar-generate \

  --schema monkey.json \

  --destination ./my-monkeys

  ```


  Boom, you now have:


  API:

  - GraphQL API

  - REST API

  - Working Tests


  APP:

  - React create item form

  - React table that supports
    - search
    - sort
    - filter
    - pagination
    - edit item
    - create item


  ### Start the API


  ```sh

  cd ./my-monkeys/api

  npm i

  npm run start


  # http://localhost:7777

  ```


  ### Start the APP


  ```sh

  cd ./my-monkeys/app

  npm i

  npm run dev


  # http://localhost:3000

  ```


  ### Behold Magic


  A fully functioning react table and form with searching sorting filtering, editing, adding, global search, download, and refresh.

  ## Experimental Embeddable Components


  **What if you could remotely update your components without having to push new code?**


  Thats one question we're exploring with the experimental embeddable react components. There are of course cool ways to serve single pages as serverless functions but what's cooler would be a way for even non-technical people to update a database schema and a form or table in real time without writing any code.



  - Each component comes out in an embeddable format under */embed*

  - TBD - How to easily deploy these and use them.

  ## Updates


  - 8/5/19 support for mongo arrays in documents

  # OpenAPI Snippet

  **Generates code snippets from Open API (previously Swagger) documents.**


  This package takes as input an OpenAPI v2.0 or v3.0.x document. It translates the document into an [HTTP Archive 1.2 request object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request). It uses the [HTTP Snippet](https://github.com/Mashape/httpsnippet) library to generate code snippets for every API endpoint (URL path + HTTP method) defined in the specification in various languages & tools (`cURL`, `Node`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `Java`, `Go`, `C#`...), or for selected endpoints.


  ## Installation


  ```bash

  npm i openapi-snippet

  ```


  ## Build OpenAPI Snippet (for use in browser)

  Clone this repository. Install required dependencies:


  ```bash

  npm i

  ```


  Build a minified version of OpenAPI Snippet (`openapisnippet.min.js`):


  ```bash

  npm run build

  ```


  ## Usage


  ### As a module


  ```javascript

  const OpenAPISnippet = require('openapi-snippet')


  // define input:

  const openApi = ... // Open API document

  const targets = ['node_unirest', 'c'] // array of targets for code snippets. See list below...


  try {
    // either, get snippets for ALL endpoints:
    const results = OpenAPISnippet.getSnippets(openApi, targets) // results is now array of snippets, see "Output" below.

    // ...or, get snippets for a single endpoint:
    const results2 = OpenAPISnippet.getEndpointSnippets(openApi, '/users/{user-id}/relationship', 'get', targets)
  } catch (err) {
    // do something with potential errors...
  }

  ```


  ### Within the browser


  Include the `openapisnippet.min.js` file created after building the the library (see above) in your HTML page:


  ```html

  <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/openapisnippet.min.js"></script>

  ```


  Use OpenAPI Snippet, which now defines the global variable `OpenAPISnippet`.



  ## Output

  The output for every endpoint is an object, containing the `method`, `url`, a human-readable `description`, and the corresponding `resource` - all of these values stem from the OpenAPI document. In addition, within the `snippets` list, an object containing a code snippet for every chosen target is provided. As of version `0.4.0`, the snippets include exemplary payload data.


  If `getSnippets` is used, an array of the above described objects is returned.


  For example:


  ```js

  [
    // ...
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{user-id}/relationship",
      "description": "Get information about a relationship to another user.",
      "resource": "relationship",
      "snippets": [
        {
          "id": "node",
          "title": "Node + Native",
          "content": "var http = require(\"https\");\n\nvar options = {..."
        }
      ]
    }
    // ...
  ]

  ```


  ## Targets

  Currently, OpenAPI Snippet supports the following targets (depending on the HTTP Snippet library):


  * `c_libcurl` (default)

  * `csharp_restsharp` (default)

  * `go_native` (default)

  * `java_okhttp`

  * `java_unirest` (default)

  * `javascript_jquery`

  * `javascript_xhr` (default)

  * `node_native` (default)

  * `node_request`

  * `node_unirest`

  * `objc_nsurlsession` (default)

  * `ocaml_cohttp` (default)

  * `php_curl` (default)

  * `php_http1`

  * `php_http2`

  * `python_python3` (default)

  * `python_requests`

  * `ruby_native` (default)

  * `shell_curl` (default)

  * `shell_httpie`

  * `shell_wget`

  * `swift_nsurlsession` (default)


  If only the language is provided (e.g., `c`), the default library will be selected.

  ## Support and Documentation:


  We’ve recently launched our developer community where you’ll be able to help, get tips-n-tricks and keep up to speed with all the latest developments: https://developers.42crunch.com/


  ## Quick start


  After installing the plugin, open any JSON or YAML file that contains an OpenAPI definition. The plugin automatically detects that this is an OpenAPI file, and the **/API** button is shown in the left-hand panel.


  ![OpenAPI Explorer](./images/OpenAPI%20Explorer.PNG)


  We also encourage you to watch [this video](https://42crunch.com/tutorial-openapi-swagger-extension-vs-code/#Introducing-OpenAPI-Editor) that gives you a full tour of the editor and its different features.


  ## Editor features


  This extension makes it easier and faster to navigate your OpenAPI definitions, especially when they get longer.


  You can home in on elements in the OpenAPI explorer view, or jump directly to the target of a reference in the API. You can also add new elements to your API directly in the OpenAPI explorer directly where they are needed. Filling in the details is quicker with IntelliSense support for OpenAPI elements.


  ### Creating OpenAPI files


  1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** on Windows or Linux, or **Cmd+Shift+P** on a Mac.

  2. In the command prompt, start typing `new openapi`, and click the corresponding command to create either an OAS v2 or v3 template file.

  3. Use the OpenAPI explorer to populate the template with new paths and other elements as needed.

  4. Save the file to your disk to fully enable IntelliSense.

  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20More!-red) Watch this [video](https://42crunch.com/tutorial-openapi-swagger-extension-vs-code/#Navigating-OpenAPI-Explorer) on editor basics.


  ### Navigating an API definition


  1. Open an OpenAPI file.

  2. Click the OpenAPI button to switch to the OpenAPI explorer view.

  3. Expand the sections and elements in the file as needed, and click the ones you want to jump to in the editor.

  1. In OpenAPI explorer pane, go to the section where you want to add a new element and right-click on the relevant node to open a context menu.

  2. Click the item you want to add from the list.


  ![Add new API path and verb](./images/Add%20paths%20and%20verbs.gif?raw=true)


  ### Use IntelliSense


  As you start typing OpenAPI elements or their values, the context-sensitive list of available options is displayed in the IntelliSense menu. In JSON OpenAPI files, just type double-quote (`"`) to show the menu, and type further to filter the list. In YAML OpenAPI files, start typing the property name.


  You can also use the corresponding VS Code hotkey (**Ctrl+Space** on Windows, **Cmd+Space** on Mac) to open the IntelliSense menu.


  ![IntelliSense for OpenAPI editing](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi/blob/master/images/Intellisense.gif?raw=true)


  ### Jump to a reference


  Use Go to Definition to locate the targets of references easily. To jump to view the definition from a reference in your API, either **Ctrl+click** a reference, or right-click a reference and click **Go to Definition** in the shortcut menu.


  ![Go to definition](./images/Go%20to%20Definition.gif?raw=true)


  ### Sort entries in the navigation pane


  By default, entries in the OpenAPI Explorer pane are sorted alphabetically. If you want to instead have them sorted in the order they are in the OpenAPI file, change the corresponding setting:


  1. On the **File** menu, click **Preferences > Settings**.

  2. Expand the **Extensions** section and click **OpenAPI**.

  3. Clear the checkbox **Alphabetically sort contents of OpenAPI explorer outlines**.


  ![](./images/OutlineSettings.png)


  ### Preview OpenAPI documentation


  You can get a documentation-style preview of the API you are editing by clicking the Preview button <img src="./images/Preview_button.png" width=19 /> at the top right:


  ![OpenAPI Preview Pane](./images/OASPreview.png)


  The extension supports two popular OpenAPI documentation generators: [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc).


  To change the default OpenAPI Preview rendering engine:


  1. On the **File** menu, click **Preferences > Settings**.

  2. Expand the **Extensions** section and click **OpenAPI**.

  3. Pick the option of your choice from the **Default Preview Rendered** dropdown list.


  ![OpenAPI Preview Pane](./images/Change_OpenAPI_Preview_engine.png)


  ### Execute operations with "Try it"


  With "Try it", you can invoke operations defined in your OpenAPI directly from VS Code:


  - Click on "Try it" code lens which is displayed right below the HTTP verb (e.g. "get", "post") of your operation and in the examples section.

  - The payload data will be generated based on the request JSON Schema, or the first example available. You can edit this information before sending the request.


  ![TryIt view](./images/tryit.png)


  Try it comes with a number of limitations:


  - Sending files is not supported

  - It works best with text-based responses, such as JSON

  - Binary/image responses will be shown as text


  ### Generate JSON schemas based on the response content


  "Try it" can be used to generate JSON Schema based on the body of the response.


  - Select "Tools" tab in the TryIt response

  - Click "Generate schema" button.


  ![TryIt response tools](images/tryit-schema.png)


  ### Configure authentication for external references in OpenAPI files


  If you use references to schemas served by an authenticated HTTP service (such as an Schema Registry service or a repository), you'll need to configure the list of approved hosts in the extension settings. To do this:


  1. On the **File** menu, click **Preferences > Settings**.

  2. Expand the **Extensions** section and click **OpenAPI**.

  3. Locate the **Openapi: Approved Hostnames** setting, click on **Add item**, and write the hostname you need for resolving external references.
     ![Configure approved hosts and authentication](./images/Configure%20approved%20hosts.png)

  In case some of the approved hosts requires authentication, you can configure it in the OpenAPI > External References section of the `42Crunch: Open Settings` command view:


  ![Configure approved hosts and authentication](./images/Configure%20approved%20hosts%20authentication.png)


  <br>


  > To open this view, go to `View > Command Palette...` in VSCode menu and type in `42Crunch`, you'll see the Open Settings command listed below:

  > ![42Crunch: Open Settings](./images/42Crunch%20Open%20Settings.png)

  > You can also use keyboard shortcuts for the Command Palette **Ctrl+Shift+P**, or **Cmd+Shift+P** for Mac users.


  <br>


  After configuring all hosts you need to refer to, all OpenAPI references to any of the approved hosts will be dynamically resolved when linting or previewing your API.


  ## Static API Security Testing


  You can use this OpenAPI extension to check the quality and security of your API definition as you work on it. This feature is powered by 42Crunch [Audit](https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/concepts/api_contract_security_audit.htm?utm_campaign=IDE&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=vscode). 42Crunch Audit performs a static analysis of the API definition that includes more than 300 checks on best practices and potential vulnerabilities related to authentication, authorization as well as data constraints.


  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20More!-green) Watch this [video](https://42crunch.com/free-user-faq/#Free-API-Security-Testing-FAQs-00) to learn more about 42Crunch Audit.


  You can run the audit service in freemium or platform mode:


  - **Using our freemium centralized service**: this service is a fully featured version of the audit, but with usage limits. In this mode, OAS files are sent to the service, audited and a report is returned. This is a stateless service: **we do not keep the OpenAPI file, nor the report.**

  - New! **Using the 42Crunch CLI**: in this mode, audits are performed locally (on the user's machine). This is only available to <u>freemium</u> users for now. Support for local audit/scans using a platform API token will be available soon. In this mode, **OpenAPI files and reports are kept locally**.

  - **Using 42Crunch SaaS platform**: this requires an account on a 42Crunch platform, which is available to customers and to prospects evaluating our product. In this case, you need to supply your platform URL and an IDE token (which can be created from the platform home page). You can specify those settings by invoking `42Crunch: Update platform credentials` from the command palette.


  ![IDE-PlatformIntegration](./images/IDE-PlatformIntegration.png)


  ### Getting a Freemium Token


  To run Security Audit from VS Code, you need a token. The first time you try to audit or scan an API, you are asked to provide your email address or an API token from the platform.


  Once you supply the address, the extension requests the token to be sent to your mailbox. Paste the token you received in the prompt in VS Code, and you are all set.


  Watch this short [video](https://42crunch.com/free-user-faq/#Free-API-Security-Testing-FAQs-02) which takes you through those steps.


  ### Running an audit


  You can use OpenAPI extension to check the quality of your API as you work on it. You can run the audit directly from VS Code by clicking the Audit button in the toolbar. Alternatively, you can run an audit for an individual endpoint using the code lens.


  ![](./images/StartAudit.png)


  ### Navigating the issues in the audit report


  After the audit finishes, you get the audit report directly in the VS Code view, side by side with your code. The report viewer provides handy ways to navigate the found issues, even if the report is quite long.


  #### Priority issues


  Look here for issues that require the most attention.


  - **Most Common issues**: this list contains issues that are occuring the most, and how many times they are repeated.

  - **Opportunities**: this list contains issues that, if fixed, will most contribute to raise the audit score.


  Those two lists will often overlap and in certain cases be identical, but this is totally normal.


  ![AuditIssuesList](./images/AuditIssuesList.png)


  #### Full issue list


  The full issue list contains all issues found. The list can be filtered in two ways:


  - **Using the security gate (SQG) toggle**: an SQG enforces enterprise compliance and hightlights issues that are offending the requirements established, such as a minimal score, issues severity or specific issues (e.g. an API key is used when only OAuth is allowed across the enterprise). When the toggle is on, only the issues affecting the SQG status are shown.


  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Note%20-blue) SQG results are not visible yet to all Freemium users.


  ![AuditIssuesList-Full](./images/AuditIssuesList-Full.png)


  - **Using the filtering options**: you can also use filtering options to drill-down into the list such as severity, category or even a specific issue type.


  #### Issues details


  For each issue, you have access to full information about the issue, why it is relevant and recommendations on how to address the issue.


  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20More!-green) Watch this [video](https://42crunch.com/free-user-faq/#Free-API-Security-Testing-FAQs-2) to learn more about audit and how to navigate issues.


  ### Fixing issues


  Many of the issues reported by 42Crunch Audit have fixes associated with them. These are code snippets that you can insert into the OpenAPI file and then customize with the appropriate value.


  1. Cick some of the error lines in your OpenAPI file to bring up the QuickFix blue icon on the left of the line.

  2. Click the Quickfix icon and select the fix to apply.

  3. Tweak the values in the inserted code snippet as you see fit.


  ![Quick Fixes in VSCode](./images/Quick_Fixes_in_VSCode.gif)


  ## (New!) Dynamic API Security testing


  42Crunch Audit performs a security analysis that does not require any live API, just the definition itself. 42Crunch Scan leverages the OpenAPI definition to:


  - Test the resilience and behavior of APIs by automatically generating security tests from the APIs' OpenAPI definition. Scan reproduces the typical behavior of a hacker by injecting bad payloads, bad tokens, and using invalid HTTP verbs and paths. This helps detect vulnerabilities early in the API life cycle, especially those associated with the [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://apisecurity.io/owasp-api-security-top-10/owasp-api-security-top-10-project/).

  - Validate that the implementation of the API conforms to its established contract: Scan checks all responses against the OpenAPI definition and detects unexpected responses and data leaks.


  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20More!-Blue) Watch this [video](https://42crunch.com/free-user-faq/?utm_campaign=IDE&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=vscode#Free-API-Security-Testing-FAQs-4) to learn more about 42Crunch Scan.


  APIs which thoroughly enforce compliance to an established contract are far more resilient to all types of attacks.


  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Important-red) You must only use 42Crunch Scan against APIs that you own, not those of third parties.


  ### Launching 42Crunch Scan


  We recommend you use the 42Crunch API Security Testing Binary to run scans. The alternative is to run a docker image locally. 42Crunch customers can also leverage our [scand manager](https://github.com/42Crunch/scand-manager), by deploying an API-driven scan engine on Kubernetes.


  In order to run a scan, you will need :


  - **A credential** : most likely, your API is using some form of authentication, like an API Key or token. You need a valid credential to provide to the scan engine.


  - **The URL** when the API is deployed.

    ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-orange) We strongly recommend that you do <u>not</u> target a production system. While the tool does not try to inject malicious payloads, it is possible that the API implementation is not resilient enough to handle the tests and may crash or behave unexpectedly.

  When you first launch a scan, you are presented with the scan configuration viewer. The scan configuration is generated automatically from the OpenAPI file you chose to scan.


  - For each operation in the OpenAPI file, a request is created. You can test individual requests using the **Try** button top-right.

    ![](./images/ScantryIt.png)

  - Requests can be arranged into testing scenarios: a scenario combines one or multiple requests, for example you need to create a resource before you can view it. The editor allows you to extract data as variables from a request execution to inject it into the next step.

    Similarly to requests, you can test an individual scenario to ensure it is built correctly before starting a scan: the scan engine will execute the scenario and if successful, launch automatically dozens of tests using the data provided in the OpenAPI file. The scan will send bad verbs, bad data types, bad data formats as well as authentication tests.

    ![](./images/ScanScenarios.png)

  Once the scan has run, you are presented with a results page. The summary shows if the scan got a testing baseline by running the HappyPath test. Additional testing results are visible from the tests list. For each issue, you can easily reproduce the problem using a curl request.


  ![](./images/ScanReport.gif)


  ## Miscellaneous commands


  - You can load results of Security Audit from a file for a currently open OpenAPI file by running command `42Crunch: Load Security Audit report from file` from the command palette


  ## Network requirements


  To execute the 42Crunch Freemium services, you need access to the following URL: https://stateless.42crunch.com. You may need to ask your administrators to add a firewall rule to allow the connection.


  ## Known issues


  - For new files, IntelliSense does not work until you save the file. File extension must be `.json` or `.yaml`.

  - When running 42Crunch Scan on a host with incorrect clock, the scan can fail with the message `cannot send the scan report : rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = invalid input`, to resolve the issue make sure your clock is correctly set.

    * Got a question? Need some guidance? Start a [discussion](https://github.com/Cornutum/tcases/discussions).

  ## What Does It Do? ##


  Tcases is a tool for designing tests. It doesn't matter what kind of system you are testing -- UI, command line,

  [REST-ful API](tcases-openapi/README.md#tcases-for-openapi-from-rest-ful-to-test-ful), or backend.  Nor does it matter

  what level of the system you are testing -- unit, subsystem, or full system. You can use Tcases to design your tests in any of

  these situations. With Tcases, you define the input space for your system-under-test and the level of coverage that you

  want. Then Tcases generates a minimal set of test cases that meets your requirements.


  Tcases is primarily a tool for black-box test design. For such tests, the concept of "coverage" is different from structural

  testing criteria such as line coverage, branch coverage, etc. Instead, Tcases is guided by coverage of the input space of your

  system.


  Tcases gives you a way to define the input space for your system in a form that is concise but comprehensive. Then Tcases allows

  you to control the number of test cases in your sample subset by specifying the level of coverage you want. You can start with a

  basic level of coverage, and Tcases will generate a small set of test cases that touches every significant element of the input

  space. Then you can improve your tests by selectively adding coverage in specific high-risk areas. For example, you can specify

  pairwise coverage or higher-order combinations of selected input variables.


  ## How Does It Work? ##


  First, you create a system input definition, a document that defines your system as a set of functions. For each system

  function, the system input definition defines the variables that characterize the function input space. If you are testing a Web

  service API, you can even [generate a system input definition automatically](tcases-openapi/README.md#tcases-for-openapi-from-rest-ful-to-test-ful)

  from an OpenAPI definition.


  Then, you can create a generator definition. That's another document that defines the coverage you want for each system

  function. The generator definition is optional. You can skip this step and still get a basic level of coverage.


  Finally, you run Tcases. Tcases is a Java program that you can run from the command line or using the

  [Tcases Maven Plugin](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/tcases-maven-plugin/). The command line version of Tcases comes with built-in

  support for running using a shell script or an ant target. Using your input definition and your generator definition, Tcases

  generates a system test definition. The system test definition is a document that lists, for each system function, a set of test

  cases that provides the specified level of coverage. Each test case defines a specific value for every function input

  variable. Tcases generates not only valid input values that define successful test cases but also invalid values for the tests

  cases that are needed to verify expected error handling.


  Of course, the system test definition is not something you can execute directly. (Unless it was

  [derived automatically from an OpenAPI definition](tcases-openapi/README.md#how-do-you-run-generated-api-test-cases)!)

  But it follows a well-defined schema, which means you can use a variety of transformation tools to convert it into a form that

  is suitable for testing your system. For example, Tcases comes with a built-in transformer that converts a system test

  definition into a Java source code template for a JUnit or TestNG test class.

  A Common Lisp library for handling Web API specifications. This allows to validate and parse HTTP request headers, parameters and bodies with OpenAPI3 specification.


  ## Warning


  This software is still ALPHA quality. The APIs will be likely to change.


  ## Prerequisite


  * [libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) for loading OpenAPI spec files.


  ## Usage


  ### Loading specification file


  ```common-lisp

  (defvar *spec*
    (apispec:load-from-file #P"docs/api.yaml"))

  (apispec:spec-version *spec*)

  ;=> "3.0.2"

  ```


  ### Getting the operation


  ```common-lisp

  (defvar *router* (apispec:spec-router *spec*))


  (apispec:find-route *router* :GET "/users/12")

  ;=> #<APISPEC/CLASSES/OPERATION:OPERATION {1003DDB073}>

  ```


  ### Parsing and Validating HTTP requests


  ```common-lisp

  (import '(lack.request:request-query-parameters
            lack.request:request-body-parameters
            lack.request:request-cookies
            apispec:request-path-parameters))

  ;; Clack application

  (defvar *app*
    (lambda (env)
      (multiple-value-bind (operation path-parameters)
          (apispec:find-route (spec-router *spec*)
                              (getf env :request-method)
                              (getf env :path-info))
        ;; Getting Lack.Request
        (let ((request (apispec:validate-request operation env
                                                 :path-parameters path-parameters)))
          ;; Write the main application here.

          ;; Accessors for getting each parameters.
          (request-query-parameters request)  ;=> Query parameters (alist)
          (request-body-parameters request)   ;=> Body parameters (alist)
          (request-path-parameters request)   ;=> Path parameters (alist)
          (request-cookies)                   ;=> Cookie parameters (alist)

          ))))

  ;; Start the server

  (clack:clackup *app*)

  ```


  ### Validating and Encoding HTTP responses


  ```common-lisp

  (import 'lack.response:make-response)


  (apispec:validate-response operation
                             (make-response 200
                                            '(:content-type "application/json")
                                            '(("id" . 3)
                                              ("name" . "初音ミク")
                                              ("is_admin" . nil))))
  ;=> (200 (:CONTENT-TYPE "application/json") ("{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"初音ミク\",\"is_admin\":false}"))

  ```


  ### Custom Encoder for standard objects


  ```common-lisp

  (import 'lack.response:make-response)


  ;; Custom class

  (defclass user ()
    ((id :initarg :id)
     (name :initarg :name)
     (is-admin :initarg :is-admin)))

  ;; Define APISPEC:ENCODE-OBJECT for the class

  (defmethod apispec:encode-object ((user user))

  # OpenAPI Snippet

  **Generates code snippets from Open API (previously Swagger) documents.**


  This package takes as input an OpenAPI v2.0 or v3.0.x document. It translates the document into an [HTTP Archive 1.2 request object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request). It uses the [HTTP Snippet](https://github.com/Mashape/httpsnippet) library to generate code snippets for every API endpoint (URL path + HTTP method) defined in the specification in various languages & tools (`cURL`, `Node`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `Java`, `Go`, `C#`...), or for selected endpoints.


  ## Installation


  ```bash

  npm i openapi-snippet

  ```


  ## Build OpenAPI Snippet (for use in browser)

  Clone this repository. Install required dependencies:


  ```bash

  npm i

  ```


  Build a minified version of OpenAPI Snippet (`openapisnippet.min.js`):


  ```bash

  npm run build

  ```


  ## Usage


  ### As a module


  ```javascript

  const OpenAPISnippet = require('openapi-snippet')


  // define input:

  const openApi = ... // Open API document

  const targets = ['node_unirest', 'c'] // array of targets for code snippets. See list below...


  try {
    // either, get snippets for ALL endpoints:
    const results = OpenAPISnippet.getSnippets(openApi, targets) // results is now array of snippets, see "Output" below.

    // ...or, get snippets for a single endpoint:
    const results2 = OpenAPISnippet.getEndpointSnippets(openApi, '/users/{user-id}/relationship', 'get', targets)
  } catch (err) {
    // do something with potential errors...
  }

  ```


  ### Within the browser


  Include the `openapisnippet.min.js` file created after building the the library (see above) in your HTML page:


  ```html

  <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/openapisnippet.min.js"></script>

  ```


  Use OpenAPI Snippet, which now defines the global variable `OpenAPISnippet`.



  ## Output

  The output for every endpoint is an object, containing the `method`, `url`, a human-readable `description`, and the corresponding `resource` - all of these values stem from the OpenAPI document. In addition, within the `snippets` list, an object containing a code snippet for every chosen target is provided. As of version `0.4.0`, the snippets include exemplary payload data.


  If `getSnippets` is used, an array of the above described objects is returned.


  For example:


  ```js

  [
    // ...
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{user-id}/relationship",
      "description": "Get information about a relationship to another user.",
      "resource": "relationship",
      "snippets": [
        {
          "id": "node",
          "mimeType": "application/json",  // Only set for methods with a request body
          "title": "Node + Native",
          "content": "var http = require(\"https\");\n\nvar options = {..."
        }
      ]
    }
    // ...
  ]

  ```


  ## Targets

  Currently, OpenAPI Snippet supports the following [targets](https://github.com/Kong/httpsnippet/tree/master/src/targets) (depending on the HTTP Snippet library):


  * `c_libcurl` (default)

  * `csharp_restsharp` (default)

  * `csharp_httpclient`

  * `go_native` (default)

  * `java_okhttp`

  * `java_unirest` (default)

  * `javascript_jquery`

  * `javascript_xhr` (default)

  * `node_native` (default)

  * `node_request`

  * `node_unirest`

  * `objc_nsurlsession` (default)

  * `ocaml_cohttp` (default)

  * `php_curl` (default)

  * `php_http1`

  * `ruby_native` (default)

  * `shell_curl` (default)

  * `shell_httpie`

  * `shell_wget`

  * `swift_nsurlsession` (default)


  If only the language is provided (e.g., `c`), the default library will be selected.

  Chai and Jest support for asserting that HTTP responses satisfy an OpenAPI spec.


  ## Problem


  If your server's behaviour doesn't match your API documentation, then you need to correct your server, your documentation, or both. The sooner you know the better.


  ## Solution


  These plugin let you automatically test whether your server's behaviour and documentation match. They extend Chai and Jest to support the [OpenAPI standard](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) for documenting REST APIs. In your JavaScript tests, you can simply assert `expect(responseObject).toSatisfyApiSpec()`

  Schemathesis

  ============


  |Build| |Coverage| |Version| |Python versions| |Docs| |Chat| |License|


  Schemathesis is a tool for testing your web applications built with Open API / Swagger or GraphQL specifications.


  It reads the application schema and generates test cases which will ensure that your application is compliant with its schema.


  The application under test could be written in any language, the only thing you need is a valid API schema in a supported format.


  **Supported specification versions**:


  - Swagger 2.0

  - Open API 3.0.x

  - GraphQL June 2018


  More API specifications will be added in the future.


  Built with:


  - `hypothesis`_


  - `hypothesis_jsonschema`_


  - `hypothesis_graphql`_


  - `pytest`_


  Inspired by wonderful `swagger-conformance <https://github.com/olipratt/swagger-conformance>`_ project.


  **Docs**: https://schemathesis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/


  **Gitter**: https://gitter.im/kiwicom/schemathesis


  If you are looking for more information:


  - `An article <https://code.kiwi.com/schemathesis-property-based-testing-for-api-schemas-52811fd2b0a4>`_ about Schemathesis by **@Stranger6667**

  - `A video <https://youtu.be/1lo7idI7uq8>`_ from FlaskCon 2020 by **@hultner**


  Installation

  ------------


  To install Schemathesis via ``pip`` run the following command:


  .. code:: bash

      pip install schemathesis

  Usage

  -----


  There are two basic ways to use Schemathesis:


  - `Command Line Interface <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis#command-line-interface>`_

  - `Writing tests in Python <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis#in-code>`_


  CLI is pretty simple to use and requires no coding, in-code approach gives more flexibility.


  Command Line Interface

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  The ``schemathesis`` command can be used to perform Schemathesis test cases:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  .. image:: https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis/blob/master/img/schemathesis.gif


  If your application requires authorization then you can use ``--auth`` option for Basic Auth and ``--header`` to specify

  custom headers to be sent with each request.


  To filter your tests by endpoint name, HTTP method, Open API tags or operationId you could use ``-E``, ``-M``, ``-T``, ``-O`` options respectively.


  CLI supports passing options to ``hypothesis.settings``. All of them are prefixed with ``--hypothesis-``:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run --hypothesis-max-examples=1000 https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  To speed up the testing process Schemathesis provides ``-w/--workers`` option for concurrent test execution:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run -w 8 https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  In the example above all tests will be distributed among 8 worker threads.


  If you'd like to test your web app (Flask or AioHTTP or FastAPI for example) then there is ``--app`` option for you:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run --app=importable.path:app /swagger.json

  You need to specify an importable path to the module where your app instance resides and a variable name after ``:`` that points

  to your app. **Note**, app factories are not supported. The schema location could be:


  - A full URL;

  - An existing filesystem path;

  - In-app endpoint with schema.


  This method is significantly faster for WSGI apps, since it doesn't involve network.


  For the full list of options, run:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis --help
      # Or
      schemathesis run --help

  Docker

  ~~~~~~


  Schemathesis CLI also available as a docker image


  .. code:: bash

      docker run kiwicom/schemathesis:stable run http://example.com/schema.json

  To run it against localhost server add ``--network=host`` parameter:


  .. code:: bash

      docker run --network="host" kiwicom/schemathesis:stable run http://127.0.0.1/schema.json

  Pre-run CLI hook

  ################


  Sometimes you need to execute custom code before the CLI run, for example setup an environment,

  register custom string format strategies or modify Schemathesis behavior in runtime you can use ``--pre-run`` hook:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis --pre-run importable.path.to.module run https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  **NOTE**. This option should be passed before the ``run`` part.


  The passed value will be processed as an importable Python path, where you can execute your code.

  An example - https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis#custom-string-strategies


  Registering custom checks for CLI

  #################################


  To add a new check for the Schemathesis CLI there is a special function


  .. code:: python

      import schemathesis

      @schemathesis.register_check
      def new_check(response, case):
          # some awesome assertions!
          pass

  The registered check should accept a ``response`` with ``requests.Response`` / ``schemathesis.utils.WSGIResponse`` type and

  ``case`` with ``schemathesis.models.Case`` type.


  After registration, your checks will be available in Schemathesis CLI and you can use them via ``-c`` command line option.


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis --pre-run module.with.checks run -c new_check https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  Additionally, checks may return ``True`` to skip the check under certain conditions. For example, you may only want to run checks when the

  response code is ``200``.


  .. code:: python

      import schemathesis

      @schemathesis.register_check
      def conditional_check(response, case):
          if response.status_code == 200:
              # some awesome assertions!
          else:
              # check not relevant to this response, skip test
              return True

  In-code

  ~~~~~~~


  To examine your application with Schemathesis you need to:


  - Setup & run your application, so it is accessible via the network;

  - Write a couple of tests in Python;

  - Run the tests via ``pytest``.


  Suppose you have your application running on ``http://0.0.0.0:8080`` and its

  schema is available at ``http://0.0.0.0:8080/swagger.json``.


  A basic test, that will verify that any data, that fit into the schema will not cause any internal server error could

  look like this:


  .. code:: python

      # test_api.py
      import requests
      import schemathesis

      schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8080/swagger.json")

      @schema.parametrize()
      def test_no_server_errors(case):
          # `requests` will make an appropriate call under the hood
          response = case.call()  # use `call_wsgi` if you used `schemathesis.from_wsgi`
          # You could use built-in checks
          case.validate_response(response)
          # Or assert the response manually
          assert response.status_code < 500


  It consists of four main parts:


  1. Schema preparation; ``schemathesis`` package provides multiple ways to initialize the schema - ``from_path``, ``from_dict``, ``from_uri``, ``from_file`` and ``from_wsgi``.


  2. Test parametrization; ``@schema.parametrize()`` generates separate tests for all endpoint/method combination available in the schema.


  3. A network call to the running application; ``case.call`` does it.


  4. Verifying a property you'd like to test; In the example, we verify that any app response will not indicate a server-side error (HTTP codes 5xx).


  **NOTE**. Look for ``from_wsgi`` usage `below <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis#wsgi>`_


  Run the tests:


  .. code:: bash

      pytest test_api.py

  **Other properties that could be tested**:


  - Any call will be processed in <50 ms - you can verify the app performance;

  - Any unauthorized access will end with 401 HTTP response code;


  Each test function should have the ``case`` fixture, that represents a single test case.


  Important ``Case`` attributes:


  - ``method`` - HTTP method

  - ``formatted_path`` - full endpoint path

  - ``headers`` - HTTP headers

  - ``query`` - query parameters

  - ``body`` - request body


  You can use them manually in network calls or can convert to a dictionary acceptable by ``requests.request``:


  .. code:: python

      import requests

      schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8080/swagger.json")

      @schema.parametrize()
      def test_no_server_errors(case):
          kwargs = case.as_requests_kwargs()
          response = requests.request(**kwargs)


  For each test, Schemathesis will generate a bunch of random inputs acceptable by the schema.

  This data could be used to verify that your application works in the way as described in the schema or that schema describes expected behavior.


  By default, there will be 100 test cases per endpoint/method combination.

  To limit the number of examples you could use ``hypothesis.settings`` decorator on your test functions:


  .. code:: python

      from hypothesis import settings

      @schema.parametrize()
      @settings(max_examples=5)
      def test_something(client, case):
          ...

  To narrow down the scope of the schemathesis tests it is possible to filter by method or endpoint:


  .. code:: python

      @schema.parametrize(method="GET", endpoint="/pet")
      def test_no_server_errors(case):
          ...

  The acceptable values are regexps or list of regexps (matched with ``re.search``).


  WSGI applications support

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  Schemathesis supports making calls to WSGI-compliant applications instead of real network calls, in this case

  the test execution will go much faster.


  .. code:: python

      app = Flask("test_app")

      @app.route("/schema.json")
      def schema():
          return {...}

      @app.route("/v1/users", methods=["GET"])
      def users():
          return jsonify([{"name": "Robin"}])

      schema = schemathesis.from_wsgi("/schema.json", app)

      @schema.parametrize()
      def test_no_server_errors(case):
          response = case.call_wsgi()
          assert response.status_code < 500

  Explicit examples

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  If the schema contains parameters examples, then they will be additionally included in the generated cases.

  Schemathesis supports the use of both OpenAPI ``example`` and ``examples`` (more information available in the `OpenAPI documentation <https://swagger.io/docs/specification/adding-examples/>`_).

  Note that ``examples`` were added in OpenAPI 3, but Schemathesis supports this feature for OpenAPI 2 using ``x-examples``.


  .. code:: yaml

      paths:
        get:
          parameters:
          - in: body
            name: body
            required: true
            schema: '#/definitions/Pet'

      definitions:
        Pet:
          additionalProperties: false
          example:
            name: Doggo
          properties:
            name:
              type: string
          required:
          - name
          type: object


  With this Swagger schema example, there will be a case with body ``{"name": "Doggo"}``.  Examples handled with

  ``example`` decorator from Hypothesis, more info about its behavior is `here`_.


  If you'd like to test only examples provided in the schema, you could utilize ``--hypothesis-phases=explicit`` CLI option:


  .. code:: bash

      $ schemathesis run --hypothesis-phases=explicit https://example.com/api/swagger.json

  Or add this decorator to your test if you use Schemathesis in your Python tests:


  .. code:: python

      from hypothesis import settings, Phase

      ...
      @schema.parametrize()
      @settings(phases=[Phase.explicit])
      def test_api(case):
          ...

  **NOTE**. Schemathesis supports examples in individual properties.

  See below:


  .. code:: yaml

      ...
      paths:
        /users:
          parameters:
            - in: query
              name: foo
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  prop1:
                    type: string
                    example: prop1 example    # SUPPORTED!
          post:
            requestBody:
              content:
                application/json:
                  schema:
                    type: object
                    properties:
                      foo:
                        type: string
                        example: bar          # SUPPORTED!

  Direct strategies access

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  For convenience you can explore the schemas and strategies manually:


  .. code:: python

      >>> import schemathesis
      >>> schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8080/petstore.json")
      >>> endpoint = schema["/pet"]["POST"]
      >>> strategy = endpoint.as_strategy()
      >>> strategy.example()
      Case(
          path='/pet',
          method='POST',
          path_parameters={},
          headers={},
          cookies={},
          query={},
          body={
              'name': '\x15.\x13\U0008f42a',
              'photoUrls': ['\x08\U0009f29a', '\U000abfd6\U000427c4', '']
          },
          form_data={}
      )

  Schema instances implement ``Mapping`` protocol.


  **NOTE**. Paths are relative to the schema's base path (``host`` + ``basePath`` in Open API 2.0 and ``server.url`` in Open API 3.0):


  .. code:: python

      # your ``basePath`` is ``/api/v1``
      >>> schema["/pet"]["POST"]  # VALID
      >>> schema["/api/v1/pet"]["POST"]  # INVALID

  Lazy loading

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~


  If you have a schema that is not available when the tests are collected, for example it is build with tools

  like ``apispec`` and requires an application instance available, then you can parametrize the tests from a pytest fixture.


  .. code:: python

      # test_api.py
      import schemathesis

      schema = schemathesis.from_pytest_fixture("fixture_name")

      @schema.parametrize()
      def test_api(case):
          ...

  In this case the test body will be used as a sub-test via ``pytest-subtests`` library.


  **NOTE**: the used fixture should return a valid schema that could be created via ``schemathesis.from_dict`` or other

  ``schemathesis.from_`` variations.


  Extending schemathesis

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  If you're looking for a way to extend ``schemathesis`` or reuse it in your own application, then ``runner`` module might be helpful for you.

  It can run tests against the given schema URI and will do some simple checks for you.


  .. code:: python

      from schemathesis import runner

      events = runner.prepare("http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger.json")
      for event in events:
          # do something with event

  ``runner.prepare`` creates a generator that yields events of different kinds - ``BeforeExecution``, ``AfterExecution``, etc.

  They provide a lot of useful information about what happens during tests, but handling of these events is your responsibility.

  You can take some inspiration from Schemathesis `CLI implementation <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis/blob/master/src/schemathesis/cli/__init__.py#L230>`_.

  See full description of events in the `source code <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis/blob/master/src/schemathesis/runner/events.py>`_.


  If you want to use Schemathesis CLI with your custom checks, look at `this section <https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis/tree/dd/deprecate-execute#registering-custom-checks-for-cli>`_


  The built-in checks list includes the following:


  - Not a server error. Asserts that response's status code is less than 500;

  - Status code conformance. Asserts that response's status code is listed in the schema;

  - Content type conformance. Asserts that response's content type is listed in the schema;

  - Response schema conformance. Asserts that response's content conforms to the declared schema;


  You can provide your custom checks to the execute function, the check is a callable that accepts one argument of ``requests.Response`` type.


  .. code:: python

      from datetime import timedelta
      from schemathesis import runner, models

      def not_too_long(response, case: models.Case):
          assert response.elapsed < timedelta(milliseconds=300)

      events = runner.prepare("http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger.json", checks=[not_too_long])
      for event in events:
          # do something with event

  Custom string strategies

  ########################


  Some string fields could use custom format and validators,

  e.g. ``card_number`` and Luhn algorithm validator.


  For such cases it is possible to register custom strategies:


  1. Create ``hypothesis.strategies.SearchStrategy`` object

  2. Optionally provide predicate function to filter values

  3. Register it via ``schemathesis.register_string_format``


  .. code-block:: python

      strategy = strategies.from_regex(r"\A4[0-9]{15}\Z").filter(luhn_validator)
      schemathesis.register_string_format("visa_cards", strategy)

  Unittest support

  ################


  Schemathesis supports Python's built-in ``unittest`` framework out of the box,

  you only need to specify strategies for ``hypothesis.given``:


  .. code-block:: python

      from unittest import TestCase
      from hypothesis import given
      import schemathesis

      schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8080/petstore.json")
      new_pet_strategy = schema["/v2/pet"]["POST"].as_strategy()

      class TestSchema(TestCase):

          @given(case=new_pet_strategy)
          def test_pets(self, case):
              response = case.call()
              assert response.status_code < 500

  Schema validation

  #################


  To avoid obscure and hard to debug errors during test runs Schemathesis validates input schemas for conformance with the relevant spec.

  If you'd like to disable this behavior use ``--validate-schema=false`` in CLI and ``validate_schema=False`` argument in loaders.


  Local development

  -----------------


  First, you need to prepare a virtual environment with `poetry`_.

  Install ``poetry`` (check out the `installation guide`_) and run this command inside the project root:


  .. code:: bash

      poetry install

  For simpler local development Schemathesis includes a ``aiohttp``-based server with the following endpoints in Swagger 2.0 schema:


  - ``/api/success`` - always returns ``{"success": true}``

  - ``/api/failure`` - always returns 500

  - ``/api/slow`` - always returns ``{"slow": true}`` after 250 ms delay

  - ``/api/unsatisfiable`` - parameters for this endpoint are impossible to generate

  - ``/api/invalid`` - invalid parameter definition. Uses ``int`` instead of ``integer``

  - ``/api/flaky`` - returns 1/1 ratio of 200/500 responses

  - ``/api/multipart`` - accepts multipart data

  - ``/api/teapot`` - returns 418 status code, that is not listed in the schema

  - ``/api/text`` - returns ``plain/text`` responses, which are not declared in the schema

  - ``/api/malformed_json`` - returns malformed JSON with ``application/json`` content type header



  To start the server:


  .. code:: bash

      ./test_server.sh 8081

  It is possible to configure available endpoints via ``--endpoints`` option.

  The value is expected to be a comma separated string with endpoint names (``success``, ``failure``, ``slow``, etc):


  .. code:: bash

      ./test_server.sh 8081 --endpoints=success,slow

  Then you could use CLI against this server:


  .. code:: bash

      schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8081/schema.yaml
      ================================== Schemathesis test session starts =================================

  About

  #####


  Openapi-core is a Python library that adds client-side and server-side support

  for the `OpenAPI v3.0 <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md>`__

  and `OpenAPI v3.1 <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md>`__ specification.



  Key features

  ############


  * **Validation** and **unmarshalling** of request and response data (including webhooks)

  * **Integration** with popular libraries (Requests, Werkzeug) and frameworks (Django, Falcon, Flask, Starlette)

  * Customization with media type **deserializers** and format **unmarshallers**

  * **Security** data providers (API keys, Cookie, Basic and Bearer HTTP authentications)



  Documentation

  #############


  Check documentation to see more details about the features. All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at `openapi-core.readthedocs.io <https://openapi-core.readthedocs.io>`__



  Installation

  ############


  Recommended way (via pip):


  .. code-block:: console

     pip install openapi-core

  Alternatively you can download the code and install from the repository:


  .. code-block:: console

     pip install -e git+https://github.com/python-openapi/openapi-core.git#egg=openapi_core


  First steps

  ###########


  Firstly create your specification object.


  .. code-block:: python

     from openapi_core import Spec

     spec = Spec.from_file_path('openapi.json')

  Now you can use it to validate and unmarshal against requests and/or responses. 


  .. code-block:: python

     from openapi_core import unmarshal_request

     # raises error if request is invalid
     result = unmarshal_request(request, spec=spec)

  Retrieve validated and unmarshalled request data


  .. code-block:: python

     # get parameters
     path_params = result.parameters.path
     query_params = result.parameters.query
     cookies_params = result.parameters.cookies
     headers_params = result.parameters.headers
     # get body
     body = result.body
     # get security data
     security = result.security

  Request object should implement OpenAPI Request protocol. Check `Integrations <https://openapi-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integrations.html>`__ to find oficially supported implementations.


  For more details read about `Unmarshalling <https://openapi-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unmarshalling.html>`__ process.


  If you just want to validate your request/response data without unmarshalling, read about `Validation <https://openapi-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html>`__ instead.

  ## Installation

  Install via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (requires **Python 3.6+**):


  ```bash

  pip install hmt

  ```


  macOS users can install HMT with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):


  ```sh

  brew tap meeshkan/tap

  brew install hmt

  ```


  Debian and Ubuntu users can install HMT with `apt`:


  ```sh

  echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://dl.bintray.com/meeshkan/apt all main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list

  apt-get -qq update && apt-get install hmt

  ```



  ## Getting started with HMT


  The basic HMT flow is **collect, build and mock.**

  1. First, **collect** data from recorded server traffic and/or OpenAPI specs.

  1. Then, **build** a schema that unifies these various data sources.

  1. Finally, use this schema to create a **mock** server of an API.


  ### Tutorial


  The quickest way to get an overview of HMT is to complete our interactive tutorial. It walks you through the collect, build, and mock flow - while also covering the concepts necessary for development.


  _Note: This tutorial has been tested on Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8._


  After installing HMT, you can begin the tutorial by invoking from the command line:


  ```bash

  $ hmt tutorial

  ```


  Once you've run this, you should see:


  ```bash
      __              __ 
     / /_  ____ ___  / /_
    / __ \/ __ `__ \/ __/
   / / / / / / / / / /_
  /_/ /_/_/ /_/ /_/\__/

  If not, it's probably our fault. Please let us know by [filing an issue on this repo](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/issues).


  ## Collect recordings of API traffic


  Let's look at how to build a HMT spec. First, you have to **collect** recordings of server traffic and/or OpenAPI server specs.


  To record API traffic, the HMT CLI provides a `record` mode that captures API traffic using a proxy.


  ```bash

  $ hmt record

  ```


  This command starts HMT as a reverse proxy on the default port of `8000` and creates two directories: `logs` and `specs`. 


  With [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), for example, you can use HMT as a proxy like so:


  ```bash

  $ curl http://localhost:8000/http://api.example.com

  ```


  By default, the recording proxy treats the path as the target URL. It then writes a [`.jsonl`](https://jsonlines.org) file containing logs of all server traffic to the `logs` directory.  All logs are created in the [`http-types`](https://github.com/meeshkan/http-types) format. This is because HMT's `build` tool expects all recordings to be represented in a `.jsonl` file containing recordings represented in the `http-types` format.


  For more information about recording, including direct file writing and kafka streaming, see the [recording documentation](./docs/RECORD.md).


  ## Build a HMT spec from recordings


  Using the HMT CLI, you can **build** an OpenAPI schema from a single `.jsonl` file, in addition to any existing OpenAPI specs that describe how your service works.


  ```bash

  $ hmt build --input-file path/to/recordings.jsonl 

  ```


  _Note: The input file should be in [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) format and every line should be in [http-types](https://hmt.github.io/http-types/) JSON format. For an example input file, see [recordings.jsonl](./resources/recordings.jsonl)._


  Optionally, you can also specify an output directory using the `--out` flag followed by the path to this directory. By default, HMT will build the new OpenAPI specifications in the `specs` directory. 


  Use dash (`--input-file -`) to read from standard input:


  ```bash

  $ hmt build --input-file - < recordings.jsonl

  ```

  ### Building modes

  You can use a mode flag to indicate how the OpenAPI spec should be built, for example:


  ```bash

  hmt build --input-file path/to/recordings.jsonl --mode gen

  ```


  Supported modes are:

  * gen [default] - infer a schema from the recorded data

  * replay - replay the recorded data based on exact matching


  For more information about building, including mixing together the two modes and editing the created OpenAPI schema, see the [building documentation](./docs/BUILD.md).


  ## Mock server traffic using a HMT spec


  You can use an OpenAPI spec, such as the one created with `hmt build`, to create a **mock** server using HMT.


  ```bash

  $ hmt mock path/to/dir/

  ```


  _Note: You can specify a path to the directory your OpenAPI spec is in or a path to one specific file._


  For more information about mocking, including adding custom middleware and modifying the mocking schema JIT via an admin API, see the [mocking documentation](./docs/MOCK.md).


  ## Development


  Here are some useful tips for building and running HMT from source. 


  If you run into any issues, please [reach out to our team on Gitter](https://gitter.im/HMT/community).


  ### Getting started


  1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt`

  1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`

  1. Install dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -e '.[dev]'`

  1. Install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to automatically format code as a git hook: `pre-commit install`


  ### Tests


  Run all checks:


  ```bash

  $ python setup.py test

  ```


  #### `pytest`


  Run [tests/](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/tests/) with `pytest`:


  ```bash

  pytest

  # or

  python setup.py test

  ```


  Configuration for `pytest` is found in [pytest.ini](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/pytest.ini).


  #### Formatting


  Formatting is checked by the above mentioned `python setup.py test` command.


  To fix formatting:


  ```sh

  $ python setup.py format

  ```


  #### `flake8`


  Run style checks:


  ```bash

  $ flake8 .

  ```


  #### `pyright`


  You can run type-checking by installing [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) globally:


  ```bash

  $ npm -i -g pyright

  ```


  And then running:


  ```bash

  $ pyright --lib

  $ # or

  $ python setup.py typecheck

  ```


  Using the [Pyright extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-pyright.pyright) is recommended for development in VS Code.


  ### Automated builds


  Configuration for CircleCI [build pipeline](https://app.circleci.com/github/HMT/hmt/pipelines) can be found in [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/.circleci/config.yml).


  ### Publishing HMT as a PyPi package


  To publish HMT as a PyPi package, complete the following steps:


  1. Bump the version in [setup.py](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/setup.py) if the version is the same as in the published [package](https://pypi.org/project/hmt/). Commit and push.

  1. Run `python setup.py test` to check that everything works

  1. To build and upload the package, run `python setup.py upload`. Insert PyPI credentials to upload the package to `PyPI`. The command will also run `git tag` to tag the commit as a release and push the tags to remote.


  > To see what the different commands do, see `Command` classes in [setup.py](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt/tree/master/setup.py).

  > ⚠️ Swagger CLI has been deprecated, due to the maintenance burnden of trying to keep up with expectations of a huge userbase with little to no pull requests or support. [Redocly CLI](https://redocly.com/redocly-cli/) covers all of the same functionality, and has more advanced linting with custom rules, and we highly recommend using that instead. They have conveniently provided a [migration guide](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/guides/migrate-from-swagger-cli/) for existing Swagger CLI users. Read the review of [Redocly CLI from APIs You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/redocly-cli/).


  Features

  --------------------------

  - Validate Swagger/OpenAPI files in **JSON or YAML** format

  - Supports multi-file API definitions via `$ref` pointers

  - Bundle multiple Swagger/OpenAPI files into one combined file




  Related Projects

  --------------------------

  - [Swagger Parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-parser)

  - [Swagger Express Middleware](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware)




  Installation

  --------------------------

  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):


  ```bash

  npm install -g @apidevtools/swagger-cli

  ```




  Usage

  --------------------------


  ```

  swagger-cli <command> [options] <file>


  Commands:
      validate                Validates an API definition in Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 format

      bundle                  Bundles a multi-file API definition into a single file

  Options:
      -h, --help              Show help for any command
      -v, --version           Output the CLI version number
      -d, --debug [filter]    Show debug output, optionally filtered (e.g. "*", "swagger:*", etc.)
  ```



  ### Validate an API


  The `swagger-cli validate` command will validate your Swagger/OpenAPI definition against the [Swagger 2.0 schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json) or [OpenAPI 3.0 Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.json).  It also performs additional validations against the [specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md), which will catch some things that aren't covered by the schema, such as duplicate parameters, invalid MIME types, etc.


  The command will exit with a non-zero code if the API is invalid.


  ```

  swagger-cli validate [options] <file>


  Options:
      --no-schema             Do NOT validate against the Swagger/OpenAPI JSON schema

      --no-spec               Do NOT validate against the Swagger/OpenAPI specification
  ```


  #### Git pre-commit hook


  There is a useful Python tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) that can be used to execute a wide suite of pre-commit checks. The `swagger-cli validate` command can be integrated as part of a git pre-commit hook by adding the following configuration to the `repos` entry of an existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.


  ```

  -   repo: https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-cli
      rev: v2.2.1
      hooks:
      - id: swagger-validation
        args: ["validate", "<path to root swagger>"]
  ```


  The intention is to point to single root swagger that references multiple swagger definitions. The above hook will execute the `swagger-cli validation` against the root swagger anytime that a file matching the pattern `.*swagger.*\.(json|yaml|yml)` is modified. Any failures in this validation will prevent the git commit from being processed.


  ### Combine Multiple Files


  The Swagger and OpenAPI specs allows you to split your API definition across multiple files using [`$ref` pointers](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#reference-object) to reference each file. You can use the `swagger-cli bundle` command to combine all of those referenced files into a single file, which is useful for distribution or interoperation with other tools.


  By default, the `swagger-cli bundle` command tries to keep the output file size as small as possible, by only embedding each referenced file _once_.  If the same file is referenced multiple times, then any subsequent references are simply modified to point to the _single_ inlined copy of the file.  If you want to produce a bundled file without _any_ `$ref` pointers, then add the `--dereference` option.  This will result in a larger file size, since multiple references to the same file will result in that file being embedded multiple times.


  If you don't specify the `--outfile` option, then the bundled API will be written to stdout, which means you can pipe it to other commands.


  The result of this method by default is written as JSON. It can be changed to YAML with the `--type` option, by passing the `yaml` value.


  ```

  swagger-cli bundle [options] <file>


  Options:
      -o, --outfile <file>        The output file

      -r, --dereference           Fully dereference all $ref pointers

      -f, --format <spaces>       Formats the output using the given number of spaces
                                  (the default is 2 spaces)

      -t, --type <filetype>       Defines the output file type. The valid values are: json, yaml
                                  (the default is JSON)

      -w, --wrap <column>         Set the line length for YAML strings
                                  (the default is no wrapping)
  ```

  Swagger Express Middleware

  ============================

  ### Swagger 2.0 middleware and mocks for Express.js


  > :warning: **No longer maintained**

  > This package has been abandoned for some time, and there are plenty of modern alternatives around which support OpenAPI v3.x listed on [OpenAPI.Tools](https://openapi.tools/) which you can use instead.

  [![Buy us a tree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Treeware-%F0%9F%8C%B3-lightgreen)](https://plant.treeware.earth/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware)




  Features

  --------------------------

  - **Supports Swagger 2.0 specs in JSON or YAML** <br>

  Swagger Express Middleware uses [Swagger-Parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-parser) to parse, validate, and dereference Swagger files.  You can even split your spec into multiple different files using `$ref` pointers.


  - **Thoroughly tested**<br>

  Over 1,000 unit tests and integration tests with 100% code coverage.  Tested on [**over 1,500 real-world APIs**](https://apis.guru/browse-apis/) from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Spotify, etc.  All tests are run on Mac, Linux, and Windows using all LTS versions of Node.


  - [**Mock middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/mock.html)<br>

  **Fully-functional mock** implementations for every operation in your API, including data persistence, all with **zero code!**  This is a great way to test-drive your API as you write it, or for quick demos and POCs.  You can even extend the mock middleware with your own logic and data to fill in any gaps.


  - [**Metadata middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/metadata.html)<br>

  Annotates each request with all the relevant information from the Swagger definition.  The path, the operation, the parameters, the security requirements - they're all easily accessible at `req.swagger`.


  - [**Parse Request middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/parseRequest.html)<br>

  Parses incoming requests and converts everything into the correct data types, according to your Swagger API definition.


  - [**Validate Request middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/validateRequest.html)<br>

  Ensures that every request complies with your Swagger API definition, or returns the appropriate HTTP error codes if needed.  Of course, you can catch any validation errors and handle them however you want.


  - [**CORS middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/CORS.html)<br>

  Adds the appropriate CORS headers to each request and automatically responds to CORS preflight requests, all in compliance with your Swagger API definition.


  - [**Files middleware**](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/middleware/files.html)<br>

  Serves the Swagger API file(s) in JSON or YAML format so they can be used with front-end tools like [Swagger UI](http://www.swagger.io), [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io), and [Postman](http://getpostman.com).




  Installation and Use

  --------------------------

  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).


  ```bash

  npm install @apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware

  ```

  Then use it in your [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) script like this:


  ```javascript

  const express = require('express');

  const createMiddleware = require('@apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware');


  let app = express();


  createMiddleware('PetStore.yaml', app, function(err, middleware) {
      // Add all the Swagger Express Middleware, or just the ones you need.
      // NOTE: Some of these accept optional options (omitted here for brevity)
      app.use(
          middleware.metadata(),
          middleware.CORS(),
          middleware.files(),
          middleware.parseRequest(),
          middleware.validateRequest(),
          middleware.mock()
      );

      app.listen(8000, function() {
          console.log('The PetStore sample is now running at http://localhost:8000');
      });
  });

  ```




  Samples & Walkthroughs

  --------------------------

  Swagger Express Middleware comes two samples that use the [Swagger Pet Store API](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/samples/PetStore.yaml).


  #### Sample 1

  This sample demonstrates the most simplistic usage of Swagger Express Middleware. It simply creates a new Express Application and adds all of the Swagger middleware without changing any options, and without adding any custom middleware.


  * [Source Code](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/samples/sample1.js)

  * [Walkthrough](https://apitools.dev/swagger-express-middleware/docs/walkthroughs/running.html)



  #### Sample 2

  This sample demonstrates a few more advanced features of Swagger Express Middleware, such as setting a few options, initializing the mock data store, and adding custom middleware logic.


  * [Source Code](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/samples/sample2.js)

  ## Example


  ```javascript

  SwaggerParser.validate(myAPI, (err, api) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
    } else {
      console.log("API name: %s, Version: %s", api.info.title, api.info.version);
    }
  });

  ```


  Or use `async`/`await` or [Promise](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2015/02/promises/) syntax instead. The following example is the same as above:


  ```javascript

  try {
    let api = await SwaggerParser.validate(myAPI);
    console.log("API name: %s, Version: %s", api.info.title, api.info.version);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }

  ```


  For more detailed examples, please see the [API Documentation](https://apidevtools.com/swagger-parser/docs/)


  ## Installation


  Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):


  ```bash

  npm install @apidevtools/swagger-parser

  ```


  ## Usage


  When using Swagger Parser in Node.js apps, you'll probably want to use **CommonJS** syntax:


  ```javascript

  const SwaggerParser = require("@apidevtools/swagger-parser");

  ```


  When using a transpiler such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), or a bundler such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), you can use **ECMAScript modules** syntax instead:


  ```javascript

  import * as SwaggerParser from "@apidevtools/swagger-parser";

  ```


  ## Browser support


  Swagger Parser supports recent versions of every major web browser. Older browsers may require [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and/or [polyfills](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill).


  To use Swagger Parser in a browser, you'll need to use a bundling tool such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). Some bundlers may require a bit of configuration, such as setting `browser: true` in [rollup-plugin-resolve](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-node-resolve).


  ## API Documentation


  Full API documentation is available [right here](https://apidevtools.com/swagger-parser/docs/)


  ## Security


  The library, by default, attempts to resolve any files referenced using `$ref`, without considering file extensions or the location of the files. This can result in Local File Inclusion (LFI), thus, potentially sensitive information disclosure. Developers must be cautious when working with documents from untrusted sources. See [here](SECURITY.md) for more details and information on how to mitigate LFI.

  # The apicurio-studio project (Open Source API Design Studio)


  ## Summary


  This is the official Git repository for the Apicurio Studio project:  http://www.apicur.io/studio


  The Apicurio Studio project is an API design studio that can be used to create

  new or edit existing API designs (using specifications like OpenAPI or AsyncAPI).


  ## Get the code


  The easiest way to get started with the code is to [create your own fork](http://help.github.com/forking/)

  of this repository, and then clone your fork:

  ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:<you>/apicurio-studio.git
    $ cd apicurio-studio
    $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio.git
  ```

  At any time, you can pull changes from the upstream and merge them onto your main:

  ```bash
    $ git checkout main               # switches to the 'main' branch
    $ git pull upstream main          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/main' onto your 'main' branch
    $ git push origin                   # pushes all the updates to your fork, which should be in-sync with 'upstream'
  ```

  The general idea is to keep your 'main' branch in-sync with the 'upstream/main'.


  ## Building apicurio-studio


  ### Requirements

  - Node.js and NPM


  ### Building

  Use standard NPM based UI tooling to build the project:


  ```bash

  cd ui

  npm install

  npm run build

  npm run package

  ```


  ## Contribute fixes and features


  Apicurio Studio is open source, and we welcome anybody who wants to participate and contribute!


  If you want to fix a bug or make any changes, please [log an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio/issues) describing the bug or new feature. Then we highly recommend making the changes on a topic branch named with the GitHub issue number. For example, this command creates a branch for an issue with number 1234:


  ```bash
    $ git checkout -b apicurio-studio-1234
  ```


  After you're happy with your changes and a full build (with unit tests) runs successfully, commit your

  changes on your topic branch. Then it's time to check for and pull any recent changes that were made in

  the official repository:


  ```bash
    $ git checkout main               # switches to the 'main' branch
    $ git pull upstream main          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/main' onto your 'main' branch
    $ git checkout apicurio-studio-1234   # switches to your topic branch
    $ git rebase main                 # reapplies your changes on top of the latest in main
                                        # (i.e., the latest from main will be the new base for your changes)
  ```


  If the pull grabbed a lot of changes, you should rerun your build to make sure your changes are still good.

  You can then either [create patches](http://progit.org/book/ch5-2.html) (one file per commit, saved in `~/apicurio-studio-1234`) with


  ```bash
    $ git format-patch -M -o ~/apicurio-studio-1234 orgin/main
  ```


  and upload them to the JIRA issue, or you can push your topic branch and its changes into your public fork repository


  ```bash
    $ git push origin apicurio-studio-1234         # pushes your topic branch into your public fork of apicurio-studio
  ```


  and [generate a pull-request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) for your changes.


  We prefer pull-requests, because we can review the proposed changes, comment on them,

  discuss them with you, and likely merge the changes right into the official repository.


  Please try to create one commit per feature or fix, generally the easiest way to do this is via [git squash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits).

  This makes reverting changes easier, and avoids needlessly polluting the repository history with checkpoint commits.


  ## Code Formatting


  When you are hacking on some apicurio-studio code, we'd really appreciate it if you followed the

  apicurio-studio coding standards.  The project uses `eslint` to ensure these standards.  You can

  check your code using:


  ```bash

  cd ui

  npm run lint

  ```

  _"The confident hippie"_


  [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)

  [![Build Status](https://github.com/cachecontrol/hippie-swagger/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/cachecontrol/hippie-swagger/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

  [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hippie-swagger.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/hippie-swagger)


  ## Synopsis


  ```hippie-swagger``` is a tool for testing RESTful APIs.  In addition to validating api behavior, it will fail tests when swagger documentation is missing or inaccurate.


  As the test suite runs, any request or response details *not* matching the swagger file will throw an appropriate exception, failing the spec.  This ensures the swagger definition accurately describes application behavior, keeping documentation in sync with reality.


  ```hippie-swagger``` uses [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) under the hood, an excellent API testing tool.


  ## Features


  * All [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) features included

  * All aspects of swagger file validated; parameters, request/response body, paths, etc.

  * Checks for extra parameters, paths, headers, etc not mentioned in the swagger file

  * Ensures swagger file accurately describes API behavior

  * Accurate, human readable assertion messages


  ## Installation


  ```

  npm install hippie-swagger --save-dev

  ```


  ## Basic Usage


  ```js

  var hippie = require('hippie-swagger'),
      swagger = require('./my-dereferenced-swagger-file'); // see example for how to dereference swagger

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{username}')

  .pathParams({
    username: 'cachecontrol'
  })

  .expectStatus(200)

  .expectValue('user.first', 'John')

  .expectHeader('cache-control', 'no-cache')

  .end(function(err, res, body) {
    if (err) throw err;
  });

  ```


  ## Usage

  * See [hippie](https://github.com/vesln/hippie) documentation for a description of the base api

  * When specifying a url(.get, .post, .patch, .url, etc), use the [swagger path](http://swagger.io/specification/#pathsObject)

  * Provide any path variables using [pathParams](#pathparams)


  These aside, use hippie as you normally would; see the [example](example/index.js).


  ## Methods


  ### #constructor (Object app, Object swagger, Object [options])


  Test an HTTP app (like express) directly


  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger, options)

  .get('/projects')

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ### #constructor (Object swagger, Object [options])


  Test a remote HTTP app using a fully qualified url


  ```js

  hippie(swagger, options)

  .get('http://localhost:3000/projects')

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ### #pathParams(Object hash)


  Replaces variables contained in the swagger path.


  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}')

  .pathParams({
    projectId: 123,
    taskId: 99
  })

  .end(fn);

  ```


  ## Options


  To customize behavior, an ```options``` hash may be passed to the constructor.  Typically, ```options``` only need to be specified in situations where the test covers responses to improper requests (e.g. validating the application returns a 422 when a required parameter is not provided).


  ```js

  var options = {
    validateResponseSchema: true,
    validateParameterSchema: true,
    errorOnExtraParameters: true,
    errorOnExtraHeaderParameters: false
  };

  hippie(app, swagger, options)

  ```


  ```validateResponseSchema``` - Validate the server's response against the swagger json-schema definition (default: ```true```)


  ```validateParameterSchema``` - Validate the request parameters against the swagger json-schema definition (default: ```true```)


  ```validateRequiredParameters``` - Validate that required parameters were provided  (default: ```true```)


  ```errorOnExtraParameters``` - Throw an error if a parameter is missing from the swagger file  (default: ```true```)


  ```errorOnExtraHeaderParameters``` - Throw an error if a request header is missing from the swagger file.  By default this is turned off, because it results in every request needing to specify the "Content-Type" and "Accept" headers, which quickly becomes verbose. (default: ```false```)



  ## Example

  See the [example](example/index.js) folder


  ## Validations


  When hippie-swagger detects it is interacting with the app in ways not specified in the swagger file, it will throw an error and fail the test.  The idea is to use hippie's core features to write API tests as per usual, and hippie-swagger will only interject if the swagger contract is violated.


  Below are list of some of the validations that hippie-swagger checks for:


  ### Paths

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/pathNotMentionedInSwagger')

  .end(fn);

  // path does not exist in swagger file; throws:

  //    Swagger spec does not define path: pathNotMentionedInSwagger

  ```


  ### Parameter format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{userId}')

  .pathParams({
    userId: 'string-value',
  })

  .end(fn);

  // userId provided as a string, but swagger specifies it as an integer; throws:

  //    Invalid format for parameter {userId}

  ```


  ### Required Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users/{username}')

  .end(fn);

  // "username" is marked 'required' in swagger file; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in path: username

  ```


  ### Extraneous Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users')

  .qs({ page: 2, limit: 30 })

  .end(fn);

  // "page" missing from swagger file; throws:

  //    Error: query parameter not mentioned in swagger spec: "page", available params: limit

  ```


  ### Response format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .get('/users')

  .end(fn);

  // body failed to validate against swagger file's "response" schema; throws:

  //    Response from /users failed validation: [failure description]

  ```


  ### Method validation

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .post('/users')

  .end(fn);

  // "post" method not mentioned in swagger file; throws:

  //    Swagger spec does not define method: "post" in path /users

  ```


  ### Post body format

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .post('/users')

  .send({"bogus":"post-body"})

  .end(fn);


  // post body fails to validate against swagger file's "body" parameter; throws:

  //    Invalid format for parameter {body}, received: {"bogus":"post-body"}

  ```


  ### Form Url-Encoded Parameters

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .form()

  .post('/users')

  .send({})

  .end(fn);


  // "username" is {required: true, in: formData} in swagger; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in formData: username

  ```


  ### Multipart Forms

  ```js

  hippie(app, swagger)

  .header('Content-Type','multipart/form-data')

  .send()

  .post('/users/upload')

  .end(fn);


  // "fileUpload" is {required: true, in: formData, type: file} in swagger; throws:

  //    Missing required parameter in formData: fileUpload

  ```


  ## Troubleshooting


  The most common mistake is forgetting to dereference the swagger file:


  ```js

  "'Error: cant resolve reference ...'

  ```


  Dereferencing can be accomplished using [swagger-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-parser/blob/master/docs/swagger-parser.md#dereferenceapi-options-callback).  The [example](example/index.js) gives a demonstration.

  [![Go Report](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo)


  An **application** developing **framework** provide ZeroOps(zero operations), edge computing, ... that let you develope both server and client applications in Go without need to think more about any fundamental requirements, Just develope business services and user interfaces (now just graphical interface - gui), build apps as OS images or OS applications and easily just run first server node and let it distributes by many factors with inside logics not need external decision makers (automating software deployment) like Kubernetes(K8s).


  In other word, `libgo` abbreviation of `Go language library` is a repository wrapper to store all implementation of GeniusesGroup and others protocols and algorithms to make a digital software more easily in better performance.

  You can use all packages exported APIs, go generator mechanism or by [library CLI](#CLI) to access some useful APIs from command line easily.


  ## Goals

  - Provide complete framework to develope any purpose distributed application with **low||no code**.

  - No(minimum) dependency on any other repositories.

  - Compile an application as **Unikernel** instead of regular OSs binaries.

  - Develope high available and distributed software without any admin in any infrastructure layers (DevOps culture goal).

  - Let service developers act Lean and Agile in their organization.

  - [Reinvent the wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel)


  ## Not Goals

  - 


  ## Installation

  - Make project directory and suggest use your internet domain name for it.

  - initialize project version control. If you use git run `git init` or `git clone ${repository path}`.

  - init go project by `git init` and `go mod init`

  - add `libgo` to your project dependency

  - install `libgo` with `lang_eng` or your desire language

  - initialize the project with desire domain e.g. `google.com`

  - build your organization app by `libgo build` or by `go build` with desire tags and target OS and hardwares.

  - run your desire version from /bin/ directory. Strongly suggest run app by systemd on linux or other app manager on other OS.


  or easily run the following command under your project, just replace your domain name.

  ```

  mkdir {domain}

  git init

  go mod init

  go get -u github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo

  go install github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo -tags "lang_eng"

  libgo app init -d={domain}

  libgo build

  ```


  ## Commands (CLA)

  libgo has a the command-line client for the some generator APIs implement in [modules](./modules/). It provides simple access to all APIs functions to make an application, a GUI app, ....


  You can get list of all commands and their helps with `libgo help`. We just list some of important commands here that you can run them from within a Go module or any where in your project directory:

  - **Initialize a project:** `libgo app init -d=[internet-domain]`

  - **Add new domain module:** `libgo domain new -n=[domain-name]`


  ## Build tags

  - **dev_mode**: first check and change `AppMode_Dev` const in protocol package to desire behavior

  - **tcp_listener**:


  ### Developing hints

  - Complete manifest in main package of service.

  - Add other data to main package if needed.

  - Implement protocols logic by autogenerate some codes not write them manually.

  - Don't think about network when you develope a business service logic. Use `st protocol.Stream` as stream data not network stream and don't remove it even don't need it from `Process` method arguments.


  ## Protocols

  You can find protocol descriptions in its directory as now [protocol](./protocol/), [society](./society/), [ISO](./iso/)    

  Read more about each protocol or library in its [RFC](https://github.com/GeniusesGroup/RFCs)

  As [suggest here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48087) to comply with the standards we add [protocol](./protocol) package and all other libgo packages implement this package. You can implement these protocols in your own way if our packages can't satisfied you or your requirements.   

  A standard is a formalized protocol accepted by most of the parties that implement it. A protocol is not a set of rules. A protocol is the thing those rules describe the rules of. This is why programs implement a protocol and comply with a standard.


  ### Industry Protocols

  - Insurance     >> ACCORD

  - Health Care   >> HL7

  - Retail        >> GS1

  - HR            >> HRXML


  ## GIT

  Git is not the best version control mechanism for a software project, but it is the most use one.


  ### Some useful commands

  - Make project version control by ```git init```

  - Clone exiting repo by ```git clone ${repository path}```.

  - Add libgo to project as submodule by ```git submodule add -b master https://github.com/GeniusesGroup/libgo```

  - Clone existing project with just latest commits not all one ```git clone ${repository path} --recursive --shallow-submodules```

  - Change libgo version by ```git checkout tag/${tag}``` or update by ```git submodule update -f --init --remote --checkout --recursive``` if needed.


  ## Go

  ### Some useful commands

  - go build -race

  - go tool compile -S {{file-name}}.go > {{file-name}}_C.S

  - go tool objdump {{file-name}}.o > {{file-name}}_O.S

  - go build -gcflags=-m {{file-name}}.go

  - go run -gcflags='-m -m' {{file-name}}.go

  - go build -ldflags "-X version=0.1"


  ### build tags

  Some functionality in files that have build tags `//go:build tag_name` or `// +build tag_name` in the first line just build when you provided in build time like `go build -tags "dev_mode tcp_listener"`. Build tag declarations must be at the very top of a .go files. Nothing, not even comments, can be above build tags. We prefer `go:build` over `+build` because as [describe in the proposal](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-gobuild.md#transition) but below chart is how to declare in `+build` style.


  | Build Tag Syntax	            | Build Tag Sample	                        | Boolean Statement     |

  | :---:                         | :---:                                     | :---:                 |

  | Space-separated elements	    | // +build pro enterprise	                | pro OR enterprise     |

  | Comma-separated elements      | // +build pro,enterprise	                | pro AND enterprise    |

  | New line separated elements   | // +build pro<br />// +build enterprise   | pro AND enterprise    |

  | Exclamation point elements    | // +build !pro	                        | NOT pro               |

  > [!UPDATE]

  > This extension has been updated to use the latest [Burp Montoya Java API](https://portswigger.github.io/burp-extensions-montoya-api/javadoc/burp/api/montoya/package-summary.html). The extension has undergone a complete overhaul to improve both its `UI`/`UX` and performance. These changes ensure that the extension is modern and optimised for use.


  ## openapi-parser is a `Burp Suite` extension designed for `OpenAPI`-based `API` testing


  > The `OpenAPI` Specification (`OAS`) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for `REST` `APIs`, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via `OpenAPI`, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the `OpenAPI` Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

  >

  > Use cases for machine-readable `API` definition documents include, but are not limited to: interactive documentation; code generation for documentation, clients, and servers; and automation of test cases. `OpenAPI` documents describe an `API`'s services and are represented in either `YAML` or `JSON` formats. These documents may either be produced and served statically or be generated dynamically from an application.

  >

  > \- [`OpenAPI` Initiative](https://github.com/OAI/`OpenAPI`-Specification)


  Performing security assessment of `OpenAPI`-based `APIs` can be a tedious task due to `Burp Suite` (industry standard) lacking native `OpenAPI` parsing capabilities. A solution to this situation, is to use third-party tools (e.g. `SOAP-UI`) or to implement custom scripts (often on a per engagement basis) to handle the parsing of `OpenAPI` documents and integrate/chain the results to `Burp Suite` to use its first class scanning capabilities.


  openapi-parser is an `OpenAPI` parser that aims to streamline this entire process by allowing security professionals to use `Burp Suite` as a standalone tool for security assessment of `OpenAPI`-based `APIs`.


  ## Features


  - `OpenAPI` documents can be parsed either from a supplied file or URL. The extension can fetch `OpenAPI` documents directly from a URL using the `Send to Swagger Parser` feature under the `Target -> Site map` context menu.

  - Parse `OpenAPI` documents, formerly known as the `Swagger specification`, fully compliant with `OpenAPI` 2.0/3.0 Specifications (`OAS`).

  - Requests can be directly viewed/edited within the extension prior to sending them to other Burp tools.

  - Requests can be sent to the `Comparer`, `Intruder`, `Organizer`, `Repeater`, `Scanner`, `Site map` and `Scope` Burp tools.

  - Requests matching specific criterias (detailed in the 'Parameters' tab) can be intercepted to automatically match and replace the parsed parameters default values defined in the 'Parameters' tab. This feature allows for fine-tuning of the requests prior to sending them to other Burp tools (e.g., scanner). Edited requests can be viewed within the 'Modified Request (`OpenAPI` Parser)' tab of Burp's message editor.

  - Row highlighting allowing pentesters to highlight "interesting" `API` calls and/or colour code them for reporting purposes.

  - Includes an export to `CSV` feature, allowing users to easily export selected `API` requests in `CSV` format for further analysis or reporting.

  - Supports both `JSON` and `YAML` formats.


  ## Requirements


  ### 1. System requirements


  - Operating System: Compatible with `Linux`, `macOS`, and `Windows` operating systems.

  - Java Development Kit (JDK): `Version 11` or later.

  - Burp Suite Professional or Community Edition: `Version 2023.11.1.3` or later.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Please note that using any version lower than `2023.3.2` may result in a [java.lang.NoSuchMethodError](https://forum.portswigger.net/thread/montoya-api-nosuchmethoderror-275048be). It is crucial to use the specified version or a more recent one to avoid this issue.

  ### 2. Build tool


  - Gradle: `Version 8.5` or later (recommended). The [build.gradle](https://github.com/aress31/openapi-parser/blob/main/lib/build.gradle) file is provided in the project repository.


  ### 3. Environment variables


  - Set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the `JDK` installation directory.


  Please ensure that all system requirements, including a compatible version of `Burp Suite`, are met before building and running the project. Note that the project's external dependencies will be automatically managed and installed by `Gradle` during the build process. Adhering to the requirements will help avoid potential issues and reduce the need for opening new issues in the project repository.


  ## Installation


  ### 1. Compilation


  1. Ensure you have [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) installed and configured.


  2. Download the `openapi-parser` repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/aress31/openapi-parser
     cd .\openapi-parser\
     ```

  3. Build the standalone `jar`:

     ```bash
     ./gradlew fatJar
     ```

  ### 2. Loading the Extension Into `Burp Suite`


  To install `openapi-parser` in `Burp Suite`, first go to the `Extensions` tab and click on the `Add` button. Then, select the `openapi-parser-all` jar file located in the `.\build\libs` folder to load the extension.


  Alternatively, you can skip the [Compilation](#1-compilation) step entirely and download the extension directly from the [BApp Store](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/6bf7574b632847faaaa4eb5e42f1757c).


  _Note: The version distributed on the [BApp Store](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/6bf7574b632847faaaa4eb5e42f1757c) might be lagging behind the version available on this repository._


  ## Roadmap


  - [ ] Beautify the graphical user interface.

  - [ ] Deep parsing of `OpenAPI` schemas to collect all nested parameters along with their example/type.

  - [ ] Code simplification/refactoring.
    - [x] Use `MyHttpRequest` instead of `RequestWithMetadata`.
  - [x] Enable cells editing to change `API` calls directly from the `GUI`.

  - [ ] Fix the custom request editor tab to work properly with intercepted requests based on the match and replace rulesets.

  - [x] Further optimise the source code.

  - [ ] Implement support for authenticated testing (via user-supplied `API`-keys).

  - [x] Improve the `Param` column by adding parameters type (e.g. `inquery`, `inbody`).

  - [x] Improve the tables and context menus.

  - [x] Increase the extension verbosity (via the bottom panel).


  See [TODO](TODO.md) for additional outstanding tasks.

  Use Jest or Chai to assert that HTTP responses satisfy an OpenAPI spec.


  ## Problem 😕


  If your server's behaviour doesn't match your API documentation, then you need to correct your server, your documentation, or both. The sooner you know the better.


  ## Solution 😄


  These test plugins let you automatically test whether your server's behaviour and documentation match. They extend Jest and Chai to support the [OpenAPI standard](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) for documenting REST APIs. In your JavaScript tests, you can simply assert `expect(responseObject).toSatisfyApiSpec()`

  # express-jsdoc-swagger


  With this library, you can document your express endpoints using swagger [OpenAPI 3 Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) without writing YAML or JSON. You can write comments similar to `jsdoc` on each endpoint, and the dependecy is going to create the swagger UI.

  5. [Validator](#Validator)

  6. [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brikev.express-jsdoc-swagger-snippets)


  ## Prerequisites


  This library assumes you are using:


  1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

  2. [Express.js](http://www.expressjs.com)


  ## Installation


  ```

  npm i express-jsdoc-swagger

  ```


  ## Basic Usage


  ```javascript

  // index.js file

  const express = require('express');

  const expressJSDocSwagger = require('express-jsdoc-swagger');


  const options = {
    info: {
      version: '1.0.0',
      title: 'Albums store',
      license: {
        name: 'MIT',
      },
    },
    security: {
      BasicAuth: {
        type: 'http',
        scheme: 'basic',
      },
    },
    // Base directory which we use to locate your JSDOC files
    baseDir: __dirname,
    // Glob pattern to find your jsdoc files (multiple patterns can be added in an array)
    filesPattern: './**/*.js',
    // URL where SwaggerUI will be rendered
    swaggerUIPath: '/api-docs',
    // Expose OpenAPI UI
    exposeSwaggerUI: true,
    // Expose Open API JSON Docs documentation in `apiDocsPath` path.
    exposeApiDocs: false,
    // Open API JSON Docs endpoint.
    apiDocsPath: '/v3/api-docs',
    // Set non-required fields as nullable by default
    notRequiredAsNullable: false,
    // You can customize your UI options.
    // you can extend swagger-ui-express config. You can checkout an example of this
    // in the `example/configuration/swaggerOptions.js`
    swaggerUiOptions: {},
    // multiple option in case you want more that one instance
    multiple: true,
  };


  const app = express();

  const PORT = 3000;


  expressJSDocSwagger(app)(options);


  /**
   * GET /api/v1
   * @summary This is the summary of the endpoint
   * @return {object} 200 - success response
   */
  app.get('/api/v1', (req, res) => res.json({
    success: true,
  }));


  app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`));

  ```

        name: 'MIT',
      },
    },
    security: {
      BasicAuth: {
        type: 'http',
        scheme: 'basic',
      },
    },
    baseDir: __dirname,
    // Glob pattern to find your jsdoc files (multiple patterns can be added in an array)
    filesPattern: './**/*.js',
  };

  ```


  2. Components definition


  ```javascript

  /**
   * A song type
   * @typedef {object} Song
   * @property {string} title.required - The title
   * @property {string} artist - The artist
   * @property {number} year - The year - double
   */
  ```


  3. Endpoint which returns a `Songs` model array in the response.


  ```javascript

  /**
   * GET /api/v1/albums
   * @summary This is the summary of the endpoint
   * @tags album
   * @return {array<Song>} 200 - success response - application/json
   */
  app.get('/api/v1/albums', (req, res) => (
    res.json([{
      title: 'abum 1',
    }])
  ));

  ```


  3. Endpoint PUT with body and path params which returns a `Songs` model array in the response.


  ```javascript

  /**
   * PUT /api/v1/albums/{id}
   * @summary Update album
   * @tags album
   * @param {string} name.path - name param description
   * @param {Song} request.body.required - songs info
   * @return {array<Song>} 200 - success response - application/json

    res.json([{
      title: 'abum 1',
    }])
  ));

  ```

  ## Validator


  We developed a new package works as a validator of your API endpoints and the documentation you create with this package. This package is [express-oas-validator](https://github.com/BRIKEV/express-oas-validator).


  **Example**


  Install using the node package registry:


  ```

  npm install --save express-oas-validator

  ```


  We have to wait until we have the full swagger schema to initiate the validator.


  ```js

  // validator.js

  const { init } = require('express-oas-validator');


  const validators = instance => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    instance.on('finish', (swaggerDef) => {
      const { validateRequest, validateResponse } = init(swaggerDef);
      resolve({ validateRequest, validateResponse });
    });

    instance.on('error', (error) => {
      reject(error);
    });
  });


  module.exports = validators;


  ```


  You can check out this also in our [example folder](https://github.com/BRIKEV/express-jsdoc-swagger/tree/master/examples/validator).


  ```js

  // index.js

  const express = require('express');

  const expressJSDocSwagger = require('express-jsdoc-swagger');

  const validator = require('./validator');


  const options = {
    info: {
      version: '1.0.0',
      title: 'Albums store',
      license: {
        name: 'MIT',
      },
    },
    filesPattern: './**.js',
    baseDir: __dirname,
  };


  const app = express();

  const instance = expressJSDocSwagger(app)(options);


  const serverApp = async () => {
    const { validateRequest, validateResponse } = await validator(instance);
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    app.use(express.json());
    /**
     * A song
     * @typedef {object} Song
     * @property {string} title.required - The title
     * @property {string} artist - The artist
     * @property {integer} year - The year
     */

    /**
     * POST /api/v1/songs
     * @param {Song} request.body.required - song info
     * @return {object} 200 - song response
     */
    app.post('/api/v1/songs', validateRequest(), (req, res) => res.send('You save a song!'));

    /**
     * POST /api/v1/name
     * @param {string} request.body.required - name body description
     * @return {object} 200 - song response
     */
    app.post('/api/v1/name', (req, res, next) => {
      try {
        // Validate response
        validateResponse('Error string', req);
        return res.send('Hello World!');
      } catch (error) {
        return next(error);
      }
    });

    /**
     * GET /api/v1/authors
     * @summary This is the summary or description of the endpoint
     * @param {string} name.query.required - name param description - enum:type1,type2
     * @param {array<string>} license.query - name param description
     * @return {object} 200 - success response - application/json
     */
    app.get('/api/v1/authors', validateRequest({ headers: false }), (req, res) => (
      res.json([{
        title: 'album 1',
      }])
    ));

    // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
      res.status(err.status).json(err);
    });

    return app;
  };


  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;


  serverApp()
    .then(app => 
      app.listen(PORT, () =>
        console.log(`Listening PORT: ${PORT}`)
      ))
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      process.exit(1);
    });
  ```

  Generate TypeScript clients to tap into OpenAPI servers.


  ![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119607625?s=200&v=4)


  ## Features


  - **AST-based**:
    Unlike other code generators `oazapfts` does not use templates to generate code but uses TypeScript's built-in API to generate and pretty-print an abstract syntax tree.
  - **Fast**: The CLI does not use any of the common Java-based tooling, so the code generation is super fast.

  - **Single file**: All functions and types are co-located in one single self-contained file.

  - **Tree-shakeable**: Individually exported functions allow you to bundle only the ones you actually use.

  - **Human friendly signatures**: The generated API methods don't leak any HTTP-specific implementation details. For example, all optional parameters are grouped together in one object, no matter whether they end up in the headers, path or query-string.


  ## Installation


  ```

  npm install oazapfts

  ```


  > **Note**

  > With version 3.0.0 oazapfts has become a runtime dependency and the generated code does no longer include all the fetch logic.


  ## Usage


  ```

  oazapfts <spec> [filename]


  Options:

  --exclude, -e tag to exclude

  --include, -i tag to include

  --optimistic

  --useEnumType

  ```


  Where `<spec>` is the URL or local path of an OpenAPI or Swagger spec (in either json or yml) and `<filename>` is the location of the `.ts` file to be generated. If the filename is omitted, the code is written to stdout.


  ### Options


  - `--optimistic` generare a client in [optimistic mode](#optimistic-mode)


  - `--useEnumType` generate enums instead of union types


  ## Consuming the generated API


  For each operation defined in the spec the generated API will export a function with a name matching the `operationId`. If no ID is specified, a reasonable name is generated from the HTTP verb and the path.


  ```ts

  import * as api from "./my-generated-api.ts";

  const res = api.getPetById(1);

  ```


  > **Note**

  > If your API is large, and you want to take advantage of tree-shaking to exclude unused code, use individual named imports instead:


  ```ts

  import { getPetById } from "./my-generated-api.ts";

  ```


  ## Fetch options


  The **last argument** of each function is an optional [`RequestOpts`](https://github.com/oazapfts/oazapfts/blob/27b296c6fc28fec4869f1b7e1a4a5585ebbd5ee9/src/runtime/index.ts#L5) object that can be used to pass options to the `fetch` call, for example to pass additional `headers` or an `AbortSignal` to cancel the request later on.


  ```ts

  const res = getPetById(1, {
    credentials: "include",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  });

  ```


  You can also use this to override the default `baseUrl` or to provide a custom `fetch` implementation.


  > **Note**

  > Instead of passing custom options to each function call, consider [overwriting the global defaults](#overriding-the-defaults).


  ## Optimistic vs. explicit responses


  Oazapfts supports two different modes to handle results,

  an [explicit](#explicit-mode) mode (the default) and an [optimistic](#optimistic-mode) mode, that makes the response handling less verbose.


  ## Explicit mode


  By default, each function returns an `ApiResponse` object that exposes the `status` code, response `headers` and the `data`.


  > **Note**

  > This mode is best suited for APIs that return different types for different response codes or APIs where you need to access not only the response body, but also the response headers. If your API is simple, and you don't need this flexibility, consider using the [optimistic mode](#optimistic-mode) instead.


  In explicit mode, each function returns a Promise for an `ApiResponse` which is an object with a `status` and a `data` property, holding the HTTP status code and the properly typed data from the response body.


  Since an operation can return different types depending on the status code, the actual return type is a _union_ of all possible responses, discriminated by their status.


  Consider the following code generated from the `petstore.json` example:


  ```ts

  /**
   * Find pet by ID
   */
  export function getPetById(petId: number, opts?: Oazapfts.RequestOpts) {
    return oazapfts.fetchJson<
      | {
          status: 200;
          data: Pet;
        }
      | {
          status: 400;
          data: string;
        }
      | {
          status: 404;
        }
    >(`/pet/${encodeURIComponent(petId)}`, {
      ...opts,
    });
  }

  ```


  In this case, the `data` property is typed as `Pet|string`. We can use a type guard to narrow down the type to `Pet`:


  ```ts

  const res = await api.getPetById(1);

  if (res.status === 200) {
    const pet = res.data;
    // pet is properly typed as Pet
  }

  if (res.status === 404) {
    const message = res.data;
    // message is a string
  } else {
    // handle the error
  }

  ```


  The above code can be simplified by using the `handle` helper:


  ```ts

  import { handle } from "oazapfts";


  await handle(api.getPetById(1), {
    200(pet) {
      // pet is properly typed as Pet
    },
    404(message) {
      // message is as string
    },
  });

  ```


  The helper will throw an `HttpError` error for any unhandled status code, unless you add a `default` handler:


  ```ts

  await handle(api.getPetById(1), {
    200(pet) {
      // ...
    },
    default(status, data) {
      // handle error
    },
  });

  ```


  ## Optimistic mode


  You can opt into the _optimistic mode_ by using the `--optimistic` command line argument.


  In this mode, each function will return a Promise for the happy path, i.e. the type specified for the first `2xx` response.


  Looking back at our Pet Store example from above, consuming the response is now much easier and less verbose:


  ```ts

  const pet = await api.getPetById(1);

  // pet is now typed as Pet!

  ```


  In case of a response other than `200` the promise will be rejected with a `HttpError`.


  ## Mixing both modes


  Sometimes you might want to use the optimistic mode for some of your API calls, but need the full `ApiResponse` for others.


  In that case, you can use the `ok`-helper function to selectively apply optimistic response handling:


  ```ts

  import { ok } from "oazapfts";


  const pet = await ok(api.getPetById(1));

  ```


  ## Overriding the defaults


  The generated file exports a `defaults` constant that can be used to override the `basePath`, provide a custom `fetch` implementation or to send additional `headers` with each request. Basically, you can set a default for any [fetch option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#options) you want.


  ```ts

  import * as api from "./api.ts";

  import nodeFetch from "node-fetch";


  // Override the spec's basePath

  api.defaults.basePath = "https://example.com/api";


  // Send this header with each request

  api.defaults.headers = {
    access_token: "secret",
  };


  // Include credentials in CORS requests, too

  api.defaults.credentials = "include";


  // Use this instead of the global fetch

  api.defaults.fetch = nodeFetch;

  ```


  ## Alternatives and integrations


  If this library doesn't fit your needs, take a look at [openapi-typescript-codegen](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen) which follows a similar philosophy but creates many individual files instead of one single self-contained file.


  If your frontend uses React, take a look at [react-api-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-api-query) which makes it easy to use an oazapfts client with React hooks in a convenient and type-safe way.


  ## About the name


  The name comes from a combination of syllables **oa** (OpenAPI) and **ts** (TypeScript) and is [pronounced 🗣](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chvb-K95rBE) like the Bavarian _O'zapt'is!_ (it's tapped), the famous words that mark the beginning of the Oktoberfest.

  [octohipster "0.2.1-SNAPSHOT"]

  ```


  # octohipster [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/myfreeweb/octohipster.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/myfreeweb/octohipster) [![unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/un-license-green.svg?style=flat)](http://unlicense.org)


  Octohipster is


  - a REST library/toolkit/microframework for Clojure

  - that allows you to build HTTP APIs

  - in a declarative [Webmachine](https://github.com/basho/webmachine/wiki/Overview)-like style, using [Liberator](https://github.com/clojure-liberator/liberator)

  - powered by [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring); you can add [rate limiting](https://github.com/myfreeweb/ring-ratelimit), [authentication](https://github.com/cemerick/friend), [metrics](http://metrics-clojure.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ring.html), [URL rewriting](https://github.com/ebaxt/ring-rewrite) and more with just middleware


  It allows you to make APIs that


  - support hypermedia ([HAL+JSON](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html), [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/) and Link/Link-Template HTTP headers; works with [Frenetic](http://dlindahl.github.com/frenetic/))

  - support multiple output formats (JSON, EDN, YAML and any custom format)

  - have [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki) documentation 

  - use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) for validation *and* documentation

  - have pagination


  ## Concepts


  - a **resource** is a single endpoint that accepts requests and returns responses

  - a **group** is a collection of resources with a single URL prefix (eg. a group /things contains resources /things/ and /things/{id}) and zero or more shared properties (usually the schema)

  - a **documenter** is a function that returns a resource which documents regular resources (Swagger, HAL root, etc)

  - a **mixin** is a function that is applied to multiple resources to give them shared behavior (eg. collection or entry behavior)

  - a **response handler** is a function that is used to encode response data to a particular content-type (JSON, EDN, YAML, etc.)

  - a **params handler** is a function that is used to decode incoming data from a particular content-type (JSON, EDN, YAML, etc.)


  ## Usage


  ```clojure

  (ns example
    (:use [octohipster core routes mixins pagination]
          [octohipster.documenters swagger schema]
          org.httpkit.server)
    (:import org.bson.types.ObjectId)

  (mg/connect!)

  (mg/set-db! (mg/get-db "octohipster-example"))


  ;;;; The "model"

  ;;;;  tip: make it a separate namespace, eg. app.models.contact

  (def contact-schema
    {:id "Contact"
     :type "object"
     :properties {:name {:type "string"}
                  :phone {:type "integer"}}
     :required [:name]})

  (defn contacts-count [] (mc/count "contacts"))

  (defn contacts-all []
    (mq/with-collection "contacts"
      (mq/find {})

    :doc {:get {:nickname "getContacts", :summary "Get all contacts"}
          :post {:nickname "createContact", :summary "Create a contact"}})

  (defresource contact-item

    :exists? (fn [ctx]
               (if-let [doc (-> ctx :request :route-params :_id contacts-find-by-id)]
                 {:contact doc}))
    :put! (fn [ctx]
            (-> ctx :request :non-query-params (contacts-update! (:contact ctx)))
            {:contact (-> ctx :request :route-params :_id contacts-find-by-id)})
    :delete! (fn [ctx]
               (-> ctx :contact contacts-delete!)
               {:contact nil})
    :doc {:get {:nickname "getContact", :summary "Get a contact", :parameters [name-param]}
          :put {:nickname "updateContact", :summary "Overwrite a contact", :parameters [name-param body-param]}
          :delete {:nickname "deleteContact", :summary "Delete a contact", :parameters [name-param]}})

  ;;;; The group

  (defgroup contact-group
    :url "/contacts"
    :add-to-resources {:schema contact-schema}  ; instead of typing the same for all resources in the group
    :resources [contact-collection contact-item])

  ;;;; The handler

  (defroutes site
    :groups [contact-group]
    :documenters [schema-doc schema-root-doc swagger-doc swagger-root-doc])

  (defn -main [] (run-server site {:port 8080}))

  # Ethereum Beacon APIs


  ![CI](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)


  Collection of RESTful APIs provided by Ethereum Beacon nodes


  API browser: [https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/)


  ## Outline


  This document outlines an application programming interface (API) which is exposed by a beacon node implementation
   which aims to facilitate [Phase 0](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs#phase-0) of the Ethereum consensus layer.

  The API is a REST interface, accessed via HTTP. The API should not, unless protected by additional security layers, be exposed to the public Internet as the API includes multiple endpoints which could open your node to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through endpoints triggering heavy processing.
   Currently, the only supported return data type is JSON.

  The beacon node (BN) maintains the state of the beacon chain by communicating with other beacon nodes in the Ethereum network.

  Conceptually, it does not maintain keypairs that participate with the beacon chain.


  The validator client (VC) is a conceptually separate entity which utilizes private keys 

  to perform validator related tasks, called "duties", on the beacon chain.
   These duties include the production of beacon blocks and signing of attestations.

  The goal of this specification is to promote interoperability between various beacon node implementations.


  ## Render 

  To render spec in browser you will need any http server to load `index.html` file

  in root of the repo.


  ##### Python

  ```

  python -m http.server 8080

  ```

  And api spec will render on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


  ##### NodeJs

  ```

  npm install simplehttpserver -g


  # OR


  yarn global add simplehttpserver


  simplehttpserver

  ```

  And api spec will render on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).


  ### Usage


  Local changes will be observable if "dev" is selected in the "Select a definition" drop-down in the web UI.


  Users may need to tick the "Disable Cache" box in their browser's developer tools to see changes after modifying the source. 


  ## Contributing

  Api spec is checked for lint errors before merge. 


  To run lint locally, install linter with

  ```

  npm install -g @redocly/cli


  # OR


  yarn global add @redocly/cli

  ```

  and run lint with

  ```

  redocly lint beacon-node-oapi.yaml 

  ```


  ## Implementations


  - [TypeScript Wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainsafe/eth2.0-api-wrapper)


  https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainsafe/eth2.0-api-wrapper

  ## Releasing


  1. Create and push tag

     - Make sure info.version in beacon-node-oapi.yaml file is updated before tagging.
     - CD will create github release and upload bundled spec file

  2. Add release entrypoint in index.html


  In SwaggerUIBundle configuration (inside index.html file), add another entry in "urls" field (SwaggerUI will load first item as default).

  Entry should be in following format(replace `<tag>` with real tag name from step 1.):

  ```javascript
           {url: "./releases/<tag>/beacon-node-oapi.json", name: "<tag>"},
  ```

  [日本語](./docs/ja/README-ja.md)


  This library provides TypeScript type definitions and extracted parameters from OpenAPI v3.0.x compliant specifications.

  TypeScript AST is used to generate the code, which is accurately converted to TypeScript code.

  Since the parameters extracted from OpenAPI can be used freely, it can be used for automatic generation of API Client and Server Side code, load balancer configuration files, etc.

  ## Usage


  The example shown here can be cloned from the [DEMO repository](https://github.com/Himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator-demo-project) to see how it works.


  ### Generate typedef-only code


  ```ts

  import * as fs from "fs";


  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";


  const main = () => {
    const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator("your/openapi/spec.yml");
    const code = codeGenerator.generateTypeDefinition();
    fs.writeFileSync("client.ts", code, { encoding: "utf-8" });
  };


  main();

  ```


  ### Generate code containing the API Client


  ```ts

  import * as fs from "fs";


  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  import * as Templates from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/templates";

  import type * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/types";


  const main = () => {
    const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator("your/openapi/spec.yml");

    const apiClientGeneratorTemplate: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Templates.FunctionalApiClient.Option> = {
      generator: Templates.FunctionalApiClient.generator,
      option: {},
    };

    const code = codeGenerator.generateTypeDefinition([
      codeGenerator.getAdditionalTypeDefinitionCustomCodeGenerator(),
      apiClientGeneratorTemplate,
    ]);

    fs.writeFileSync("client.ts", code, { encoding: "utf-8" });
  };


  main();

  ```


  ### The variation of template code


  This library provides three types of templates


  ```ts

  import * as Templates from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/templates";


  Templates.ClassApiClient.generator;

  Templates.FunctionalApiClient.generator;

  Templates.CurryingFunctionalApiClient.generator;

  ```


  #### `Templates.ClassApiClient.generator`


  We provide a class-based API client. Please inject the API client dependency and use it instead of `constructor`.


  ```ts

  export interface RequestArgs {
    httpMethod: HttpMethod;
    url: string;
    headers: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBody?: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBodyEncoding?: Record<string, Encoding>;
    queryParameters?: QueryParameters | undefined;
  }


  export interface ApiClient<RequestOption> {
    request: <T = SuccessResponses>(requestArgs: RequestArgs, options?: RequestOption) => Promise<T>;
  }


  export class Client<RequestOption> {
    private baseUrl: string;
    constructor(
      private apiClient: ApiClient<RequestOption>,
      baseUrl: string,
    ) {
      this.baseUrl = baseUrl.replace(/\/$/, "");
    }

    public async createPublisherV2<RequestContentType extends RequestContentType$createPublisherV2>(
      params: Params$createPublisherV2<RequestContentType>,
      option?: RequestOption,
    ): Promise<Response$createPublisherV2$Status$200["application/json"]> {
      const url = this.baseUrl + `/create/v2/publisher/{id}`;
      const headers = {
        "Content-Type": params.headers["Content-Type"],
        Accept: "application/json",
      };
      const requestEncodings = {
        "application/x-www-form-urlencoded": {
          color: {
            style: "form",
            explode: false,
          },
        },
        "application/json": {
          color: {
            style: "form",
            explode: false,
          },
        },
      };
      return this.apiClient.request(
        {
          httpMethod: "POST",
          url,
          headers,
          requestBody: params.requestBody,
          requestBodyEncoding: requestEncodings[params.headers["Content-Type"]],
        },
        option,
      );
    }
  }

  ```


  #### `Templates.FunctionalApiClient.generator`


  We also provide a function-based API client that replaces the class-based API client with `createClient`. Please inject the API client dependency and use it.


  ```ts

  export interface RequestArgs {
    httpMethod: HttpMethod;
    url: string;
    headers: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBody?: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBodyEncoding?: Record<string, Encoding>;
    queryParameters?: QueryParameters | undefined;
  }


  export interface ApiClient<RequestOption> {
    request: <T = SuccessResponses>(requestArgs: RequestArgs, options?: RequestOption) => Promise<T>;
  }


  export const createClient = <RequestOption>(apiClient: ApiClient<RequestOption>, baseUrl: string) => {
    const _baseUrl = baseUrl.replace(/\/$/, "");
    return {
      createPublisherV2: <RequestContentType extends RequestContentType$createPublisherV2>(
        params: Params$createPublisherV2<RequestContentType>,
        option?: RequestOption,
      ): Promise<Response$createPublisherV2$Status$200["application/json"]> => {
        const url = _baseUrl + `/create/v2/publisher/{id}`;
        const headers = {
          "Content-Type": params.headers["Content-Type"],
          Accept: "application/json",
        };
        const requestEncodings = {
          "application/x-www-form-urlencoded": {
            color: {
              style: "form",
              explode: false,
            },
          },
          "application/json": {
            color: {
              style: "form",
              explode: false,
            },
          },
        };
        return apiClient.request(
          {
            httpMethod: "POST",
            url,
            headers,
            requestBody: params.requestBody,
            requestBodyEncoding: requestEncodings[params.headers["Content-Type"]],
          },
          option,
        );
      },
    };
  };

  ```


  #### `Templates.CurryingFunctionalApiClient.generator`


  **Tree shaking support**


  We also provide a curried function-based API client that requires injection of API client for each `operationId`. The first function argument demands `ApiClient` while the second function argument demands `RequestArgs`. The `ApiClient` interface is different from the others, as it requires `uri` as an argument.


  This is designed for use cases that utilize **tree shaking**.


  ```ts

  export interface RequestArgs {
    httpMethod: HttpMethod;
    uri: string; // <------------------ Note that the uri
    headers: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBody?: ObjectLike | any;
    requestBodyEncoding?: Record<string, Encoding>;
    queryParameters?: QueryParameters | undefined;
  }

  export interface ApiClient<RequestOption> {
    request: <T = SuccessResponses>(requestArgs: RequestArgs, options?: RequestOption) => Promise<T>;
  }

  export const createPublisherV2 =
    <RequestOption>(apiClient: ApiClient<RequestOption>) =>
    <RequestContentType extends RequestContentType$createPublisherV2>(
      params: Params$createPublisherV2<RequestContentType>,
      option?: RequestOption,
    ): Promise<Response$createPublisherV2$Status$200["application/json"]> => {
      const uri = `/create/v2/publisher/{id}`;
      const headers = {
        "Content-Type": params.headers["Content-Type"],
        Accept: "application/json",
      };
      const requestEncodings = {
        "application/x-www-form-urlencoded": {
          color: {
            style: "form",
            explode: false,
          },
        },
        "application/json": {
          color: {
            style: "form",
            explode: false,
          },
        },
      };
      return apiClient.request(
        {
          httpMethod: "POST",
          uri,
          headers,
          requestBody: params.requestBody,
          requestBodyEncoding: requestEncodings[params.headers["Content-Type"]],
        },
        option,
      );
    };
  ```


  ### Split the type definition file and the API Client implementation


  ```ts

  import * as fs from "fs";


  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  import * as Templates from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/templates";

  import type * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/types";


  const main = () => {
    const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator("your/openapi/spec.yml");

    const apiClientGeneratorTemplate: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Templates.FunctionalApiClient.Option> = {
      generator: Templates.FunctionalApiClient.generator,
      option: {},
    };

    const typeDefCode = codeGenerator.generateTypeDefinition();
    const apiClientCode = codeGenerator.generateCode([
      {
        generator: () => {
          return [`import { Schemas, Responses } from "./types";`];
        },
      },
      codeGenerator.getAdditionalTypeDefinitionCustomCodeGenerator(),
      apiClientGeneratorTemplate,
    ]);

    fs.writeFileSync("types.ts", typeDefCode, { encoding: "utf-8" });
    fs.writeFileSync("apiClient.ts", apiClientCode, { encoding: "utf-8" });
  };


  main();

  ```


  ## Create a Code Template


  The examples in this section can be used in the following ways


  ```ts

  import * as fs from "fs";


  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  import type * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/types";


  /** Write the definition of the Code Template here. */

  const customGenerator: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<{}> = {
    /** .... */
  };


  const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator("your/openapi/spec.yml");


  const code = codeGenerator.generateCode([customGenerator]);


  fs.writeFileSync("output/file/name", code, { encoding: "utf-8" });

  ```


  ### Define a text-based code template


  A self-defined code generator can return an array of `string`.


  ```ts

  import * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/types";


  interface Option {
    showLog?: boolean;
  }


  const generator: Types.CodeGenerator.GenerateFunction<Option> = (payload: Types.CodeGenerator.Params[], option): string[] => {
    if (option && option.showLog) {
      console.log("show log message");
    }
    return ["Hello world"];
  };


  const customGenerator: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Option> = {
    generator: generator,
    option: {},
  };

  ```


  ### Define using the information extracted from OpenAPI Schema


  The self-defined code generator can accept parameters extracted from OpenAPI Schema.

  See Type definitions for available parameters.


  ```ts

  import * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/types";


  interface Option {}


  const generator: Types.CodeGenerator.GenerateFunction<Option> = (payload: Types.CodeGenerator.Params[], option): string[] => {
    return payload.map(params => {
      return `function ${params.operationId}() { console.log("${params.comment}") }`;
    });
  };


  const customGenerator: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Option> = {
    generator: generator,
    option: {},
  };

  ```


  ### Define any Data Types Format


  Convert a Data Type with the following `format` to any type definition.


  ```yaml

  components:
    schemas:
      Binary:
        type: string
        format: binary
      IntOrString:
        type: string
        format: int-or-string
      AandB:
        type: string
        format: A-and-B
  ```


  The option to convert the Data Type Format to an arbitrary type definition is defined as follows.


  ```ts

  import { CodeGenerator, Option } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  const option: Option = {
    convertOption: {
      formatConversions: [
        {
          selector: {
            format: "binary",
          },
          output: {
            type: ["Blob"],
          },
        },
        {
          selector: {
            format: "int-or-string",
          },
          output: {
            type: ["number", "string"],
          },
        },
        {
          selector: {
            format: "A-and-B",
          },
          output: {
            type: ["A", "B"],
            multiType: "allOf",
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  };

  const codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator(inputFilename, option);

  ```


  The typedef generated by this will look like this


  ```ts

  export namespace Schemas {
    export type Binary = Blob;
    export type IntOrString = number | string;
    export type AandB = A & B;
  }

  ```


  ### Define a code template with TypeScript AST


  You can extend your code using the API of TypeScript AST.

  You can directly use the API of TypeScript AST or use the wrapper API of TypeScript AST provided by this library.


  ```ts

  import * as Types from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/types";

  import { TsGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/api";


  interface Option {}


  const factory = TsGenerator.Factory.create();


  const generator: Types.CodeGenerator.GenerateFunction<Option> = (
    payload: Types.CodeGenerator.Params[],
    option,
  ): Types.CodeGenerator.IntermediateCode[] => {
    return payload.map(params => {
      return factory.InterfaceDeclaration.create({
        export: true,
        name: params.functionName,
        members: [],
      });
    });
  };


  const customGenerator: Types.CodeGenerator.CustomGenerator<Option> = {
    generator: generator,
    option: {},
  };

  ```


  ## API


  ### CodeGenerator


  ```ts

  import { CodeGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator";

  ```


  #### validateOpenApiSchema


  Performs validation of the input OpenAPI Schema.


  #### generateTypeDefinition


  Generates code that converts OpenAPI Schema to TypeScript type definitions.


  #### generateCode


  You can specify several of your own code generators, and the generators can use parameters extracted from OpenAPI Schema.

  It internally performs the conversion of an array of `string` or `ts.Statement` as a string.


  For example, creating a generator in units of file divisions increases the reusability of the generator.


  #### getCodeGeneratorParamsArray


  It provides parameters extracted from OpenAPI Schema.


  #### getAdditionalTypeDefinitionCustomCodeGenerator


  This is a type definition file for `Templates.FunctionalApiClient`. The reason it is not included in `generateTypeDefinition` is that you may not use the type definition generated by this function depending on your usage.


  ※ The reason it is not included in `generateTypeDefinition` is that you may not use the type definitions generated by this function depending on your application.


  ### TsGenerator


  ```ts

  import { TsGenerator } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/api";

  ```


  This is a wrapper API for the TypeScript AST used internally.

  It is subject to change without notice.


  ### OpenApiTools


  ```ts

  import { OpenApiTools } from "@himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator/dist/api";

  ```


  #### Parser


  - `OpenApiTools.Parser`


  This is the API for parsing OpenAPI Schema.

  It is subject to change without notice.


  ## Restrictions


  ### Directory Restrictions for Remote Reference


  There is a limitation on the directory structure supported.

  To simplify implementation when converting directory structures to TypeScript namespaces, Remote References using `$ref` should only be defined in the following directory structures.

  If you want to extend it, please fork this repository and do it yourself.


  ```

  spec.yml // entry file

  components/
    headers/
    parameters/
    pathItems/
    requestBodies/
    responses/
    schemas/
    paths/
  ```


  ### HTTP communication restrictions for Remote Reference


  `$ref: http://....` Currently not supported. We hope to support it in the future.


  ## Contributions


  First of all, thank you for your interest.

  When converting from the API specification to TypeScript code, resolving reference relationships can be particularly challenging, and there may not be enough test cases.

  Adding test cases is a very powerful support for stabilizing the behavior, so please report any bugs you find that are behaving strangely.

  Also, the basic design concepts of this repository can be found below. If you want to make changes that do not follow these concepts, please fork and extend them.

  If your changes are in line with the design concept, please submit a pull request or issue!


  ## Design Concept


  - Be typedef first.

  - Typedefs should not contain any entities (file size should be 0 when typedefs are converted to `.js`)

  - The directory structure should be mapped to the typedef structure.

  - No dependency on any API client library.

  - Can be extended by TypeScript AST.

  - Conform to the OpenAPI specification.

  - It should be a single file to maintain portability.


  ## Development


  ```bash

  git clone https://github.com/Himenon/openapi-typescript-code-generator.git

  cd openapi-typescript-code-generator

  pnpm i

  #### your change

  pnpm build

  pnpm run test:code:gen

  pnpm run update:snapshot # if you changed

  pnpm run test

  ```

  # Memar - Golang version   

  [![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go)

  [![Go Report](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go)


  `Memar` as a `Go language library` is a repository wrapper to store all implementation of [Memar](https://github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar) and others protocols and algorithms to make a digital software more easily in better performance.

  You can use all packages exported APIs, go generator mechanism or by [library commands](#commands-cla) to access some useful APIs from command line easily.


  If you want to get insight about memar, You MUST start reading interfaces in [protocol package](./protocol/).


  ## Installation

  - Make project directory and suggest use your internet domain name for it.

  - initialize project version control. If you use git run `git init` or `git clone ${repository path}`.

  - init go project by `go mod init`

  - add `memar` to your project dependency

  - install `memar` with `lang_eng` or your desire language

  - initialize the project with desire domain e.g. `google.com`

  - Complete manifest in main package.

  - Add other data to main package if needed.

  - Implement protocols logic by autogenerate some codes not write them manually.

  - build your organization app with desire tags and target OS and hardwares.

  - run your desire version from /bin/ directory. Strongly suggest run app by systemd on linux or other app manager on other OS.


  or easily run the following command under your project, just replace your domain name.

  ```

  mkdir {domain}

  git init

  go mod init

  go get -u github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go

  go install github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go -tags "lang_eng"

  memar app init -d={domain}

  memar app build

  ```


  ## Commands (CLA)

  memar has a the command-line client for the some generator APIs implement in [modules](./modules/). It provides simple access to all APIs functions to make an application, a GUI app, ....


  You can get list of all commands and their helps with `memar help`. We just list some of important commands here that you can run them from within a Go module or any where in your project directory:

  - **Initialize a project:** `memar app init -idn=[internet-domain-name]`

  - **Add new domain module:** `memar mod new -dn=[domain-name]`

  - **Build the apps(os images):** `memar app build`

  - **Run the app(os image):** `memar app run`


  ## Build tags

  - **dev_mode**: first check and change `AppMode_Dev` const in protocol package to desire behavior

  - **tcp_listener**:

  # Memar - Golang version   

  [![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go)

  [![Go Report](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go)


  `Memar` as a `Go language library` is a repository wrapper to store all implementation of [Memar](https://github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar) and others protocols and algorithms to make a digital software more easily in better performance.

  You can use all packages exported APIs, go generator mechanism or by [library commands](#commands-cla) to access some useful APIs from command line easily.


  If you want to get insight about memar, You MUST start reading interfaces in [protocol package](./protocol/).


  ## Installation

  - Make project directory and suggest use your internet domain name for it.

  - initialize project version control. If you use git run `git init` or `git clone ${repository path}`.

  - init go project by `go mod init`

  - add `memar` to your project dependency

  - install `memar` with `lang_eng` or your desire language

  - initialize the project with desire domain e.g. `google.com`

  - Complete manifest in main package.

  - Add other data to main package if needed.

  - Implement protocols logic by autogenerate some codes not write them manually.

  - build your organization app with desire tags and target OS and hardwares.

  - run your desire version from /bin/ directory. Strongly suggest run app by systemd on linux or other app manager on other OS.


  or easily run the following command under your project, just replace your domain name.

  ```

  mkdir {domain}

  git init

  go mod init

  go get -u github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go

  go install github.com/GeniusesGroup/memar-go -tags "lang_eng"

  memar app init -d={domain}

  memar app build

  ```


  ## Commands (CLA)

  memar has a the command-line client for the some generator APIs implement in [modules](./modules/). It provides simple access to all APIs functions to make an application, a GUI app, ....


  You can get list of all commands and their helps with `memar help`. We just list some of important commands here that you can run them from within a Go module or any where in your project directory:

  - **Initialize a project:** `memar app init -idn=[internet-domain-name]`

  - **Add new domain module:** `memar mod new -dn=[domain-name]`

  - **Build the apps(os images):** `memar app build`

  - **Run the app(os image):** `memar app run`


  ## Build tags

  - **dev_mode**: first check and change `AppMode_Dev` const in protocol package to desire behavior

  - **tcp_listener**:
